     * activeSlotRef.current, NOT the closure's `activeSlot`: a new-session /
     * forceNew send creates a fresh slot and switches the UI to it, so the
     * closure value is stale — using it would leave the user's just-typed message

     * actually on screen, so it restores visibly for a new-session failure while
     * still not splicing a targeted send's text into an unrelated slot.
     *
     * Restores `typedTxt` — what the user actually TYPED — and brings the staged
     * references back as chips, rather than restoring the link-appended `txt`.
     * Restoring `txt` preserved the reference (the link is in the text) but left
     * it as a raw URL, and re-staging the chips ON TOP of that text would make
     * the retry append each link a SECOND time. Splitting them puts the composer
     * back in exactly its pre-send state: chip visible, link appended once on
     * retry. Paste blocks come back too, or the restored text would show a dead
     * `[ Paste #N · M lines ]` literal. Shares the create-failure path's merge
     * rule so a reference staged while the send was in flight is not clobbered.
