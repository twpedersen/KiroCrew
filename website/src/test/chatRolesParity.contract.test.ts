/**
 * Role-parity contract between the two transcript render paths.
 *
 * The dashboard renders chat messages through TWO paths: ChatPage's inline
 * `renderMessage` if-chain, and the registry in `app-sdk/messageRenderers`
 * that every other surface (SideChat, ChatPane, ChatEmbed) consumes via
 * ChatMessageList. A role wired in only one path ships a surface where that
 * message renders as raw text or not at all — `mcp_oauth` shipped exactly
 * this way once, wired in app-sdk but not in the main chat.
 *
 * Until ChatPage consumes the registry directly (the chat-core extraction's
 * later phase), this contract is the guard: every role literal that ChatPage's
 * source dispatches on must be CLAIMED by the registry, or be explicitly
 * listed here as chrome-only with a reason. Adding a role branch to ChatPage
 * without touching either list fails this test.
