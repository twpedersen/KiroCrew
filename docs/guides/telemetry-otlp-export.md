# Exporting Kiro Crew metrics over OTLP

Kiro Crew records its metrics through the OpenTelemetry SDK. By default they go
nowhere but this machine: a local JSONL sink under `~/.kiro/crew/metrics`, which
the dashboard's Telemetry panel reads. This page is about the other option —
pushing the same metrics to an **OpenTelemetry Collector**, and from there to
whatever backend you already run (Amazon CloudWatch, Datadog, or any service that
accepts OTLP).

Nothing here is on by default, and turning it on takes two separate decisions:
collection, then egress.

## Default posture

| | Default | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `telemetry.enabled` | `false` | Nothing is recorded. Metric call sites are cheap no-ops. |
| `telemetry.otlp_endpoint` | `""` (empty) | Nothing leaves the machine. Local JSONL sink only. |
| `kirocrew[otlp]` extra | not installed | The OTLP exporter is not even importable. |

Collection and egress are deliberately separate switches. Enabling collection
gives you the local sink and the Telemetry panel; it does **not** send anything
anywhere. Egress needs the endpoint set *and* the extra installed.

The local sink is never replaced by OTLP — it is additive. When you configure an
endpoint you get both readers, so the dashboard keeps working and you keep a
local copy.

## Turning it on

### 1. Install the exporter

```bash
pip install "kirocrew[otlp]"
```

This pulls `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http`. Transport is **OTLP over
HTTP only** — there is no gRPC exporter, so your collector needs its OTLP
receiver's `http` protocol enabled (port 4318 by convention, not 4317).

If the extra is missing but an endpoint is configured, Kiro Crew logs a warning
and stays local-only rather than failing to start.

### 2. Enable collection

Either edit `~/.kiro/crew/config.json`:

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "otlp_endpoint": "http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics"
  }
}
```

or set the environment variable, which overrides the config flag in both
directions and is the convenient form for containers and one-off debugging:

```bash
KIROCREW_TELEMETRY=1 kirocrew gateway
```

**`otlp_endpoint` is the full signal URL, including `/v1/metrics`.** It is passed
to the exporter as-is; no path is appended for you. `http://localhost:4318` alone
will not work.

### 3. Confirm egress started

On startup the gateway logs the local sink and, separately, the fact that metrics
are leaving the machine:

```
telemetry enabled; local JSONL sink at /home/you/.kiro/crew/metrics (otlp=on)
telemetry OTLP export active; metrics leave this machine (default)
```

The second line is the one to look for. The endpoint value is never logged — only
the destination name — so a credential embedded in the URL does not end up in the
journal.

### Other settings worth knowing

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `telemetry.export_interval_seconds` | `60` | Applies to both readers. |
| `telemetry.local_dir` | `~/.kiro/crew/metrics` | Local JSONL shard directory. |
| `telemetry.retention_days` | `0` | `0` never prunes by age. |
| `telemetry.max_total_mb` | `0` | `0` never prunes by size. |

## Temporality: the setting that decides whether your backend accepts the data

Counters can be exported two ways. **Cumulative** sends the running total every
interval; **delta** sends only what changed since the last export. Backends
disagree about which they want, and sending the wrong one is the most common
reason metrics arrive but look wrong — a cumulative counter graphed as a rate, or
a delta counter treated as a total that appears to reset constantly.

Kiro Crew deliberately passes **no** temporality preference to the exporter. That
is what leaves the OpenTelemetry standard environment variable in control, so you
can match your backend without a code change:

```bash
# Cumulative — the OpenTelemetry default. CloudWatch, Prometheus-style backends.
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE=CUMULATIVE

# Delta — what Datadog and most product-analytics ingests expect.
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE=DELTA

# Delta for counters, cumulative for up-down counters.
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE=LOWMEMORY
```

Set it in the gateway's environment, not the collector's — it governs how Kiro
Crew *encodes* what it sends.

Two things are unaffected by this setting, and knowing that saves debugging time:

- **Gauges have no temporality at all.** Every instrument reporting a
  point-in-time reading (thread counts, memory, install inventory) is a gauge, so
  the preference does not apply to them.
- **The local JSONL sink is always cumulative** for counters. It is a separate
  reader with its own encoding, and the dashboard aggregator depends on it.

You can also convert temporality inside the collector with the
`cumulativetodelta` processor, which is the better lever when one collector feeds
two backends that disagree.

## Collector configuration

The examples below are collector configs. Point Kiro Crew at the collector's OTLP
HTTP receiver and let the collector fan out.

**Distribution matters.** The `otelcol` core distribution ships the OTLP receiver
and a small set of exporters. The vendor exporters below (`awsemf`, `datadog`)
are only in **`otelcol-contrib`**. Using core and wondering why an exporter is
"unknown type" is the usual first mistake.

**These samples are illustrative, not tracked.** Vendor exporter options change
with collector and vendor releases that this repository does not follow, so treat
each vendor's own collector documentation as authoritative and these blocks as a
starting shape. What is stable — and what this page actually owns — is the Kiro
Crew side: the two consent switches, the full-signal-URL requirement, and the
temporality preference.

### Shared receiver

Every example starts here:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 127.0.0.1:4318
```

Bind to `127.0.0.1` when the collector runs on the same host as the gateway. A
`0.0.0.0` bind accepts metrics from anywhere on the network and needs its own
authentication story.

### Amazon CloudWatch

The `awsemf` exporter writes CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format, which turns each
metric into a CloudWatch metric via a log group.

```yaml
exporters:
  awsemf:
    region: us-west-2
    namespace: KiroCrew
    log_group_name: /kirocrew/metrics

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [awsemf]
```

Use `CUMULATIVE` temporality with this path. Credentials come from the
collector's own environment via the standard AWS chain, so the collector needs
`logs:PutLogEvents` and `logs:CreateLogStream` on that log group.

### Datadog

```yaml
exporters:
  datadog:
    api:
      key: ${env:DD_API_KEY}
      site: datadoghq.com

processors:
  # Datadog expects delta counters. Convert here if you would rather not set the
  # temporality preference on every gateway.
  cumulativetodelta: {}

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [cumulativetodelta]
      exporters: [datadog]
```

Set `DD_API_KEY` in the collector's environment rather than inlining it.

### Any other OTLP-compatible backend

Most analytics and observability services accept OTLP/HTTP directly. Forward with
`otlphttp` and add whatever authentication header that service documents:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlphttp/vendor:
    endpoint: https://otlp.example-vendor.com
    headers:
      authorization: ${env:VENDOR_API_KEY}

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlphttp/vendor]
```

Check that vendor's documentation for three things, because they vary: the exact
endpoint (some want the base URL and append `/v1/metrics` themselves, others want
the full signal path), the header name, and the temporality they expect.

One pipeline can also carry several exporters, which is the reason to run a
collector at all rather than pointing the gateway straight at a vendor.

## What gets exported

Two families of instruments, all under the `kirocrew.` namespace:

- **`kirocrew.process.*`** — this process's own resource behavior: Python and OS
  thread counts, open file descriptors, current and peak RSS, cumulative CPU
  seconds, and per-generation GC counters.
- **`kirocrew.inventory.*`** — what this install has configured: active cron jobs,
  armed monitor loops, installed skills, whether memory has been migrated,
  knowledge-document and lesson count *bands*, MCP server counts by class, and a
  fixed set of feature switches. Plus `kirocrew.inventory.probe.failures`, which is
  absent on a healthy host and appears only when a probe cannot read its source —
  that is how you tell a broken probe from a host that stopped exporting, since
  both otherwise look like a missing series.

Resource attributes identify the sending process and are attached to every
series, so they are what you group by. `service.name` is always `kirocrew`.

### Before you build a per-host dashboard

One limitation to know up front, because it will bite a dashboard rather than
announce itself. Separating machines depends entirely on the resource attributes,
and today the only identity there comes from the OpenTelemetry SDK's own detector:
a `service.instance.id` that is **generated fresh for each process**. Two hosts are
therefore distinguishable at any given moment, but a single host's series *restarts
whenever its gateway restarts*, so a longitudinal "this machine over time" panel
will show a new series after every restart rather than one continuous line. Some
SDK versions in the supported range contribute no instance id at all, in which case
two hosts are not separable either.

This applies to every `kirocrew.*` metric, not just the inventory family, and it is
closed by giving the resource a persisted install-scoped identity. Until then,
prefer panels that group by the current instance and read point-in-time state, and
treat cross-restart continuity as unavailable.

### What these can and cannot tell you

They describe **the machines you run and have opted in**, and nothing wider. Both
switches default off and OTLP additionally needs the `kirocrew[otlp]` extra, so an
aggregate over these gauges is a statement about your own fleet — useful for
spotting a host that stopped scheduling crons or whose skills tree drifted, not a
measurement of how a feature is used in general. Kiro Crew's own install analytics
are a separate, deliberately unrelated channel (`beacon.py`), for reasons its
docstring sets out.

One practical consequence: `kirocrew.inventory.*` comes from the **gateway process
only**, while `kirocrew.process.*` comes from every telemetry-enabled process
(gateway, MCP gateway daemon, spawned agents). Install-level facts are identical
across those processes, so publishing them from each one would count a single host
once per process. If you see process metrics from a host but no inventory metrics,
the gateway on that host is not running or not exporting — that is the signal, not
a gap in collection.

### What is deliberately not exported

Reading these metrics should not tell you what a user is working on:

- **No MCP server names.** The MCP gauge publishes two counts, `first_party` and
  `third_party`. Server names are read to classify and then discarded, because a
  roster is user-chosen text — unbounded as a label and revealing as data.
- **No raw knowledge or lesson counts.** Those report a band
  (`0`, `1-10`, `11-50`, `51-200`, `200+`) rather than an exact number, which is
  what a fleet distribution actually needs and is not a slowly-changing
  fingerprint of one install.
- **No paths, endpoints, prompts, message content, or session identifiers**
  anywhere in a metric name or attribute value.
- **A subsystem that cannot answer produces no data point** rather than a zero.
  A missing series means "could not read"; a `0` means a real zero. If a series
  you expect is absent, that is the gauge telling you something.

## Verifying it end to end

### Automated

```bash
pytest test/metrics/test_otlp_wire_e2e.py
```

Two tiers. The first drives a real build through a real exporter and asserts the
instrument roster, resource-attribute fidelity, attribute values, and
temporality. The second stands up an in-process OTLP receiver on loopback, exports
to it with the real OTLP exporter, and decodes the protobuf — that tier skips
unless `kirocrew[otlp]` is installed.

### Against a real collector

The automated tiers never run an actual collector, because that needs a
downloaded binary and outbound network. Run that by hand, pinning the digest:

```bash
python3 scripts/telemetry/otlp_collector_e2e.py --expected-sha256 <digest>
```

It downloads a pinned collector release, verifies it, runs it with a file
exporter, drives one real export into it, and reports which instruments arrived.
Everything lands in a temp directory that is removed on exit; pass `--keep` to
inspect it.

Verifying against a digest you already trust is the default, and the script
refuses to download anything without one. To get that digest the first time, opt
explicitly into the weaker path:

```bash
python3 scripts/telemetry/otlp_collector_e2e.py --trust-release-checksums
```

That accepts the `checksums.txt` published with the release and prints the digest
it observed, which you then pin. It is weaker because the checksums come from the
same origin as the bytes they attest, so a compromised release could serve a
matching pair. Each collector release also publishes cosign `.sig` and `.pem`
files beside its checksums; verifying those is the strongest option and is worth
doing if you are vendoring the binary into your own infrastructure.

Instruments whose source is legitimately absent on the host are reported as
skipped rather than failures — the Linux-only thread and file-descriptor gauges on
macOS, and the knowledge, MCP, and monitor-loop gauges on an install that has
never ingested a document, configured a server, or armed a loop.

### By hand, with no collector at all

The quickest smoke test is to watch the local sink, which is fed by the same
recorder:

```bash
KIROCREW_TELEMETRY=1 kirocrew gateway
# after one export interval (60s by default)
ls ~/.kiro/crew/metrics/
python3 -m json.tool < ~/.kiro/crew/metrics/metrics-*.jsonl | head -40
```

If instruments appear there but not at your backend, the problem is the endpoint,
the collector, or temporality — not collection.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| No `telemetry OTLP export active` line | `otlp_endpoint` empty, or `kirocrew[otlp]` not installed — check for the warning naming the missing extra. |
| `OTLP exporter init failed` warning | Malformed endpoint. The message deliberately omits the URL, since it can carry a credential. |
| Local shards fill, nothing at the backend | Endpoint missing `/v1/metrics`, collector on 4317 (gRPC) instead of 4318 (HTTP), or the collector's `http` protocol not enabled. |
| Metrics arrive but counters look like resets | Temporality mismatch. See the temporality section. |
| `unknown type: "awsemf"` at collector startup | Running the core `otelcol`; vendor exporters need `otelcol-contrib`. |
| One expected series is absent | That probe could not read its source. Absence is a gap, never a zero. |
| Nothing recorded at all | Collection consent: `telemetry.enabled` is `false` and `KIROCREW_TELEMETRY` is unset. |
