# Subagent Module

## Overview

The subagent module (`kiro_crew/subagent.py`) spawns isolated background agents for parallel task execution. Each subagent gets its own LLM session via `SessionManager`, runs a focused task, and announces the result via callback.

Supports `on_tool_approval` callback for interactive tool approval (routed through gateway's approval system in Normal/Trust modes).

### Run coordinator seam

`SubagentManager` accepts an optional typed `RunCoordinator` and defaults to the
durable SQLite implementation. Construction performs no filesystem I/O. It owns
one process-lifetime `SubagentCommandAuthority`, which durably admits keyed
HTTP/MCP commands before invoking the existing synchronous manager facade. Old
internal callers that send no identity retain the compatibility path.

`spawn_run`, `spawn_continue`, `spawn_steer`, and `spawn_release` generate a
command ID and idempotency key before HTTP; spawn/continue also preassign the
visible run ID. The gateway validates all-or-none identity fields by key presence,
so an empty reserved field cannot select the identity-free compatibility path. It
recomputes the canonical semantic SHA-256 hash and fails closed on key/payload
conflicts. An
exact replay returns the stored run/control response without repeating the
manager effect. Before a stored execution response exists, an exact retry may
claim and execute a command that is still `PENDING`, because no owner has
crossed the manager boundary. A `CLAIMED` command remains a typed
pending/unavailable response rather than risking a repeated side effect. A
claimed control with no durable result remains explicitly outcome-uncertain
even after its claim expires; expiry never authorizes steer, follow-up, cancel,
or release replay because the legacy effect may already have happened. Keyed
release performs its busy check and registry mutation atomically on the gateway
event loop, then offloads only persisted-state and session-file cleanup. The
identity-free compatibility endpoint uses the same async manager boundary, so
its persisted-state update and session-file cleanup are also off the gateway
event loop. The release endpoint accepts an absent body for legacy callers, but
rejects malformed JSON and non-object JSON before either release path can run.
Cancellation has the same body contract, so malformed input cannot discard a
command identity and widen into an identity-free stop. The conversation remains
busy until that cleanup finishes, even if the awaiting request is cancelled, so
a continuation cannot reseed the registry while the off-loop worker is deleting
the same session files. A
transport-uncertain caller queries the durable command by key. Machine-coded
coordinator-unavailable and outcome-uncertain HTTP responses take the same
lookup path even when HTTP error flattening omits the transport marker; the
uncertainty marker remains set when that lookup fails or finds no record, so a
caller cannot misclassify possibly accepted work as rejected. The lookup redacts
task text before returning it; execution rejection text and provider-owned
control results are redacted before both durable persistence and synchronous
return. Every pending execution or control response carries an explicit error
so callers cannot mistake uncertain acceptance for success. Lifecycle MCP tools
render transport-uncertain results as unknown outcomes with an explicit
do-not-retry instruction instead of an ordinary retryable error. The legacy lost-wave
endpoint remains for unkeyed compatibility callers. The authenticated DELETE
endpoint accepts the same additive identity for idempotent cancellation, with
its optional fixed-shape JSON body bounded by the shared request limit.
Coordinator submission, lookup, or claim failures before the manager boundary
surface as typed authority unavailability, because the durable write may have
committed even when its response was lost.
After the manager boundary, a control exception is rethrown only when its
rejected command outcome commits. An execution exception is rejected only when
the manager confirms that the run never registered; after that rejection commits,
the authority returns a typed counted failure whose durable result is reused by
exact retries and lookup. A registered run, or a registration lookup that itself
fails, retains its claim and surfaces typed outcome uncertainty because the child
may still be executing. Any failed or rejected settlement is likewise uncertain;
an exact retry is not safe after a legacy side effect may have occurred.

The command fence has its own expiry and monotonic claim epoch. Expiry makes a
command eligible for takeover; it does not discard a completed side effect's
matching result unless a newer claimant has actually advanced the epoch.
Control commands therefore never acquire, renew, or invalidate the live
executor's run lease.
Rejected legacy admission is durably reflected as a rejected command and failed
terminal run. A claimed execution with an uncertain crash is not automatically
replayed. Accepted keyed runs carry `_coordinator_admitted`, preventing `_run`
from creating a second shadow command. Legacy synchronous spawns still submit at
async `_run` entry and await the coordinator's own bounded operation instead of
imposing a shorter caller deadline. Failures remain contained during migration.
Queued and approval-waiting keyed runs retain a bounded pre-execution lease.
Their commands remain `CLAIMED` until the manager task actually starts, so a
gateway restart cannot turn volatile queued work into a durable applied result.
If durable cancellation fails, the queued entry remains explicitly
non-runnable and the uncertainty propagates; a later cancellation retry must
settle the retained claim before removing the entry.
An approval denial follows the same order: if durable rejection fails, its live
record remains nonterminal with its slot and lease intact so cancellation can
retry settlement instead of losing the only local recovery path.
Cancelling an approval waiter marks it stopped and cancels its approval task
before awaiting durable rejection, so an approval that resolves during that
write cannot begin execution. The approval task returns without settlement even
when its callback translates cancellation into denial, leaving cancellation as
the sole durable settlement owner. A failed settlement retains the stopped,
non-runnable record and its claim for an exact cancellation retry.
The same non-runnable retention applies when queue-drain revalidation rejects a
run but durable rejection settlement fails; no completion is announced until
that command outcome commits.
Immediate keyed batch rejections also suppress the legacy pre-announcement;
their manager return retains the admitted run's fence and version, and their
authority routes the batch member through terminal commit plus the durable outbox
only after the rejected command outcome commits. This includes a
platform-composition failure raised before the manager can register the run: the
authority preserves the member's batch metadata in its durable rejection and then
normalizes the authority replay into the manager's terminal record shape before
routing that terminal member through the outbox. Manager-only coordinator fields
therefore cannot abort wave accounting for a run that never registered. Cancelling
a keyed queued batch member follows the same settle-then-announce ordering, so its
terminal event can close a wave and release already-held sibling results. If the
manager has already returned a known batch rejection but its settlement outcome is
uncertain, the authority still announces that terminal member before surfacing
uncertainty; the
claimed command remains the durable recovery record and cannot replay the manager
side effect. Cancelling an identity-free queued batch member instead routes a
synthetic stopped completion through the legacy announcement path, so wave
accounting closes even though there is no command fence to settle. Both queued
cancellation paths preserve the spawn's `silent` delivery policy when they
reconstruct the terminal record.
At task start the authority durably applies the command before stopping the
heartbeat and evicting its facade cache. A queued cancellation, approval
rejection, or orderly shutdown durably rejects the waiting command before
stopping the heartbeat; a queue-drain revalidation rejection does the same even
though the original HTTP caller has already returned. Later lifecycle work owns
any execution-time renewal. Orderly shutdown removes the manager's queued entry
before committing that rejection, so an already-scheduled drain cannot start work
whose durable command is terminal. If orderly-shutdown settlement fails, authority
shutdown stays pending and retries while retaining the command fence, facade,
and lease heartbeat instead of abandoning accepted work in a claimed state. A
durable lookup releases that local shutdown debt when the command is already
terminal or a newer claim owns it, so a legitimate takeover cannot wedge the
retiring gateway.
An active or queued legacy manager record with the requested run id rejects the
keyed request before coordinator submission, so the rejected request cannot
reserve the older run's durable identity. A synchronous manager reservation
then fences the run id across coordinator submission and claim, including an
exact retry of a matching pending command, preventing a younger legacy
admission from appearing in either await window. The direct
pre-submission rejection remains uncounted so batch reconciliation can supply
its terminal member; no lookup record exists because the coordinator namespace
remains owned by the older legacy run.
If start settlement itself is uncertain, the live
manager retries the exact idempotent settlement once to reconcile a commit whose
response was lost. The authority also looks up the exact command fence after a
failed settlement response and continues execution when that lookup proves the
matching `APPLIED` result committed. Only a second uncertain result that cannot
be confirmed leaves the record waiting and nonterminal so cancellation can retry
the retained claim instead of announcing a false failure.
Exact retries of durably rejected execution commands
decode and return the stored rejection response before considering conflict
fallbacks.
If the local executor accepts a keyed run but storing its command result fails,
the HTTP response is explicitly transport-uncertain and counted. The MCP caller
resolves the stable idempotency key. A lookup distinguishes an unclaimed
`PENDING` command from a `CLAIMED` command: the caller replays the exact keyed
request once only for `PENDING`, while `CLAIMED` remains outcome-uncertain and is
never recorded as a lost submission.

An exact execution claim also acquires the run lease. The authority passes its
run fence, command, and optimistic version through the synchronous facade and
queue payload. `_run` commits `starting` before child startup, `_run_inner`
commits `running` after session creation and before the prompt, and a 30-second
heartbeat renews the 90-second lease. A terminal failed, stopped, or interrupted
run wins lookup reconstruction when its execution command has no stored facade
result, so pre-start cancellation cannot replay as a successful spawn. Control
claims still never touch the execution lease.

The port defines typed desired/observed state, terminal outcomes, idempotent
commands, execution leases with fencing epochs, optimistic lifecycle versions,
and delivery claims with an independent fencing epoch. The in-memory adapter is
the executable contract oracle; it is not a restart store. Command records
persist the canonical payload, hash, independent claim fence, and bounded
response JSON. Controls may target runs created before the coordinator, so their
command row does not require a matching canonical run row.

### Execution boundaries

`SubagentScheduler` owns the local capacity counter, stagger clock, FIFO spawn
queue, admission decisions, and one-shot slot release. `SubagentManager` retains
only effectful queue pumping: timers, lifecycle events, calling `spawn()`, and
announcing a drained rejection. Queue payload dictionaries stay opaque so every
existing spawn option survives a queue round trip unchanged.

`SubagentLifecycle` owns terminal claim arbitration, strong ownership of
shielded report tasks, report-to-agent lookup during bounded shutdown, and
teardown gates that outlive manager registries. It uses a structural protocol
instead of importing `SubagentInfo`, keeping the manager dependency one-way.
`SubagentManager` owns the effectful delivery adapter while depending only on
the coordinator port. The winning terminal reporter commits the outcome and
outbox row before any WebSocket or parent callback. It keeps its execution
lease and shielded report alive across transient commit failures, then retries
the exact outbox event until delivery succeeds or the destination durably
defers it to its queue/digest.

Private manager views for the old counter, queue, report-task, and teardown-gate
fields remain as compatibility adapters. They delegate to these boundaries and
must not regain independent state.

### SQLite coordinator store

`SQLiteRunCoordinator` implements the shared contract with fresh short-lived
connections and offloads every filesystem/database operation from the event
loop onto a dedicated two-worker coordinator pool. Every accepted-run shadow
submission has a one-second total manager deadline; timeout is diagnostic and
legacy execution begins while an already-running SQLite worker may finish in
the coordinator pool. Lock waits therefore queue among coordinator calls and
cannot starve asyncio's shared executor after the deadline. Mutations run under
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; schema v3 uses `runs`, `commands`,
`outbox`, and `metadata`, with WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, foreign keys, a bounded
busy timeout, and a quick integrity check. Ordered, contiguous migrations are
applied in that transaction; v2 adds the durable command payload to the v1 base
schema and v3 adds independent command claims/results while permitting
pre-cutover control targets. Failed upgrades roll back cleanly for idempotent
retry. The implementation
hydrates the typed in-memory state machine from those rows and rewrites the
typed rows in the same transaction. This deliberately favors one behavioral
oracle during parity checking; targeted SQL updates replace the full-row rewrite
before coordinator authority moves.

The default path is resolved lazily as
`data_home()/run-coordinator/coordinator.db`, so a valid post-import
`KIROCREW_HOME` override is honored. The directory and database/known sidecars
are tightened owner-only, links/junctions are rejected, a newer schema is
refused before mutating PRAGMAs or sidecar creation, and corrupt databases are
never deleted or recreated. Concurrent initialization serializes the WAL-mode
transition and tolerates only a SQLite sidecar that vanishes during its ACL
preflight; a surviving sidecar or primary-database ACL failure remains fatal.
The final ACL validation runs inside the mutation transaction before commit, so
a fail-loud permission error rolls back the transition instead of reporting a
failed operation after its state became durable.

`ShadowRunCoordinator` remains available for parity tests and additive rollout.
It always returns the primary result. It calls the shadow
only after primary completion, swallows shadow failures, compares normalized
stable field classes without logging payload values, and never repairs the
primary. Keyed execution lifecycle and terminal delivery now use the durable
coordinator directly; legacy unkeyed runs retain their file-backed report path
until the restart importer lands.

### Transactional completion outbox

`mark_starting` and `mark_running` accept an exact one-version-ahead replay
under the same owner and lease epoch when the first SQLite commit succeeded but
its response was lost. Older versions and different fences still reject, so the
retry can recover the committed lifecycle version without widening ownership.
The manager retries each transition once with the same fence and expected
version, then records the returned version before advancing the lifecycle. If
both STARTING attempts fail, it leaves the command claimed for recovery and
does not apply command settlement against an unknown lifecycle state.

For a coordinator-admitted run, `complete()` verifies the execution fence and
optimistic version, writes the terminal outcome, and inserts one pending outbox
event in the same SQLite transaction. The payload contains bounded, redacted
routing metadata, a 4,000-character result summary, and `result_path`; it never
copies the full transcript. Replaying the completion returns the same
`event_id`; a conflicting outcome is rejected. Lease expiry makes the run
eligible for takeover but does not itself invalidate the monotonic fence, so
the current epoch may still commit its terminal result after host suspend if no
recovery owner has advanced the epoch first.

Unadmitted batch rejections and lost-submission records have no worker lifecycle,
so they use `record_terminal()` instead of manufacturing an execution command.
That boundary atomically creates the terminal run and pending outbox event. A
gateway exit therefore leaves either no record or a restart-drainable event,
never a pending command with no consumer. The manager publishes the live
delivery context before the commit so a concurrent drainer retains batch identity
and held-sibling settlement debt. Shutdown cancellation cannot abandon this
pre-commit window: synthetic reporters keep retrying the idempotent terminal
record until it is durable, then stop before post-commit delivery retries.
Keyed rejections normally retain the admitted
run's fence and use the normal terminal commit after command settlement. A
rejection raised before manager registration has no live record to retain that
fence, so `record_terminal()` may instead terminalize the existing `ACCEPTED` run
only when its execution command is already durably `REJECTED`; the run transition
and pending outbox insert remain one transaction. The stored run identity is
authoritative when the transient rejection view omits parent or agent metadata.

`OutboxDeliveryAdapter` claims one FIFO event immediately before each delivery,
increments the delivery claim epoch, and invokes existing gateway routing. Its
accepted path retains the stable event identity and retries transient
durable-ack failures without invoking the destination again. If the original
claim expires, it reclaims that identity for acknowledgement only, so a
prolonged coordinator outage cannot redeliver an already accepted completion.
Its 22-minute lease covers the bounded parent-injection and teardown budgets, so a
valid slow callback cannot be claimed concurrently. It acknowledges only after
that callback accepts the event. Exceptions and callback-reported routing failures
release the matching claim with bounded, overflow-safe exponential backoff.
Intentional dashboard-queue and digest holds retain the lease-length delay. A
permanently rejected execution fence stops its
reporter; periodic recovery owns the nonterminal run rather than an impossible
retry loop or a duplicate legacy delivery. A queued or immediately dispatched
dashboard turn and a wave-digest hold defer acknowledgement instead: the event
remains unavailable to background drainers for one lease window, and the
consumption/digest-settlement hooks retry transient coordinator errors before
returning and acknowledge every terminal outcome only after the parent consumes
it. An acknowledgement that waited for the claim lock rechecks the live fence
before reclaiming, so it cannot miss a claim installed while it waited. A failed
or rejected release retains the original delivery fence so an
immediate consumer acknowledgement can still settle the claimed event. If that
acknowledgement races a successful release of the original claim,
it reclaims the stable event identity and settles the new fence. Legacy delivered
tombstones remain limited to successful runs, while teardown gates retain their
compatibility role.

Delivery retries retain their manager context. Lifecycle events, orchestration
tracking, and wave accounting run once; every composed wave chunk keeps a
detached retry snapshot, so a failed non-final or final route cannot recount a
member, discard the composed chunk, or mutate later live wave progress. A retry
retains the tracker that owned its first delivery attempt, observes a stop on
that owner even if the slot has since armed a new plan, and exits before routing;
the dashboard route rechecks that owner after awaiting a busy slot and before
handoff. Only the one-shot accounting mutations are skipped on retry. Cron
injection exceptions explicitly record a routing failure before returning, so
the outbox claim remains pending. A non-empty drain result ends a synchronous
reporter only when its attempt is actually `DELIVERED`; released or pending
attempts stay in the retry loop. The execution heartbeat remains active across
transient terminal commit failures and stops only after the terminal event is
durable (or the coordinator permanently rejects the fence).

The durable completion payload retains the `silent` delivery policy and live
batch labels, child-session key, resolved model, and redacted requested model.
Restart rehydration restores the session and model metadata used by completed
cards, plus `silent`, but clears the batch identity: digest progress is volatile,
so recovered events route independently instead of synthesizing misleading
one-member wave completions.

After the dashboard or headless API destination registry is initialized,
startup reconciliation first reaps any matching live process from the legacy
folder snapshot, then drains every currently eligible bounded batch of
coordinator completions, and finally reconciles the legacy folders that remain.
Both legacy-folder snapshots are offloaded so filesystem traversal cannot block
the gateway event loop during startup.
The pre-drain reap closes the crash window where outbox delivery could write a
delivered tombstone and hide a surviving child from the later folder scan. The
drain still runs when no legacy orphan exists. Starting the reaper earlier could
misroute and acknowledge a dashboard completion before its slot exists. The
periodic reaper retries the same sequence so transient startup delivery failures
remain recoverable without another process restart.
Manager shutdown cancels and gathers the one-shot reconciliation task before
tearing down live agents.

Coordinator-backed injected envelopes include `Event: <event_id>` and
`meta.subagentCompletion.eventId`. Wave digests carry one `Event:` line for each
member and all of those identifiers in the additive `eventIds` list, while
retaining `eventId` for compatibility. Consumers may deduplicate with these
identifiers; consumers that ignore the additive fields retain at-least-once
behavior.

## Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `_MAX_CONCURRENT` | 3 | Legacy fallback / auto-size floor. `agent.max_subagents` now defaults to `0` = auto-size the cap at startup (floor 3, ceiling `agent.subagent_auto_max`, default 32); a positive value pins a fixed cap. Session-shared subagents are cost-sampled as the runtime's measured RSS/CPU divided by the live shared-session count on that PID (`_live_shared_count`), so the memory term no longer binds and the cap rises to the provider-concurrency ceiling. |
| `_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 1800 | Hard timeout per subagent (30 minutes) |
| `_SHADOW_SUBMIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 1 | Total manager deadline for best-effort accepted-run shadow submission |
| `_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT` | 1200 | Outer cap: max total seconds for semaphore wait + injection (20 minutes) |
| `INJECTION_TIMEOUT` | 900 | Inner cap: max seconds for a single `stream_and_collect` call (15 minutes); default `_DEFAULT_INJECTION_TIMEOUT = 900.0`, tunable via `KIROCREW_INJECTION_TIMEOUT` (float seconds, clamped to `_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT`) |
| `_RESET_TIMEOUT` | 30 | Max seconds for session reset in finally block |
| `_TURN_LIMIT` | 100 | Default tool-call budget per subagent (configurable via `agent.subagent_max_turns`, per-spawn via `max_turns`) |
| `_STALL_IDLE_SECS` | 120 | Seconds with no stream activity before a running subagent is surfaced as **stalled** in the running-card (configurable via `agent.subagent_stall_idle_secs`). Surface-only — a stalled subagent is never auto-terminated; the user closes it from the UX (per-row stop / Stop-all) and the 30-min `_TIMEOUT_SECS` ceiling still applies. |
| `_SYSTEM_PREFIX` | (string) | Injected before task text to prevent spawn recursion |
| `COMPLETION_KEEP_DEFAULT_CHARS` | 3000 | Default character cap for the completion event injected into the parent session (configurable via `agent.completion_keep_chars`). Lives in `context_management.py` alongside the helper. |

### Turn Limit Resolution Chain

Priority (highest wins): **per-spawn `max_turns`** → **config `agent.subagent_max_turns`** → **hardcoded default (100)**

A value of `0` means "not set" and falls through to the next level. Implemented as `SubagentManager._effective_turn_limit()`, shared by the enforcement path in `_run_inner()` and the timeout/reap error strings (`_timeout_context()`).

### Concurrency Auto-Sizing — Memory Probe (per platform)

When `agent.max_subagents == 0`, `compute_max_subagents()` sizes the cap from
host memory and CPU, clamped to `[3, agent.subagent_auto_max]`. The
available-memory term is read by `_available_memory_gb()`, which is dispatched
per operating system (see `dynamic-subagent-sizing.md`):

- **Linux** — `/proc/meminfo` `MemAvailable`, then clamped by cgroup headroom.
- **macOS** — reclaimable memory (free + inactive + speculative + purgeable
  pages) via the Mach `host_statistics64` syscall through `ctypes`/`libSystem`
  (`_macos_vm_reclaimable_pages`), combined with the `os.sysconf` page size.
  This is **in-process, non-blocking, no subprocess** — required because the
  probe runs on the gateway event loop at startup and the spawn-audit guard
  rejects unrouted subprocess spawns.
- **Other (e.g. Windows)** — no probe yet; returns `-1.0` and the cap fails
  open to the legacy floor of 3.

Hard floor: the auto-sized cap is always ≥ 3 — `compute_max_subagents` clamps to
`[3, hard_cap]` and the config loader clamps `subagent_auto_max` UP to 3 (with a
warning + `config_bounds_clamped` SEL event, mirroring the > 64 ceiling clamp).
Applies only to auto-sizing (`max_subagents=0`); an explicit `max_subagents` pin
is unrestricted (any 0..64).

Limitation: the per-spawn `spawn_min_memory_gb` admission gate
(`check_memory_available`) still reads `/proc/meminfo` and so remains inert
(fails open) on non-Linux hosts. Auto-sizing and the runtime gate are
independent guards; unifying them is out of scope for the sizing probe.

## APIs

### `SubagentManager.__init__(sessions, ctx_builder, on_done, max_concurrent)`
- `sessions: SessionManager` — provides isolated LLM sessions
- `ctx_builder: ContextBuilder` — builds context with memory/skills/hooks
- `on_done: AnnounceCallback | None` — called with `SubagentInfo` when done
- `max_concurrent: int` — capacity limit (default 3)

### `spawn(task, parent_session_key="") -> SubagentInfo | None`
Spawns a background agent. Returns `SubagentInfo` or `None` if at capacity. Uses atomic `_running_count` to prevent race conditions. `parent_session_key` tracks the originating session for completion injection.

Spawn flow:
1. **YOLO mode**: skips approval, runs immediately
2. **Parent trusted**: parent session has `approval_policy="auto"` (set by
   dashboard trust toggle) → skips approval, runs immediately
3. **Non-YOLO, non-trusted**: enters `_spawn_with_approval`, which re-checks
   YOLO (defense-in-depth against toggle race), then requests interactive
   approval with a 2-minute timeout. Timeout or rejection frees the
   concurrency slot. For coordinator-admitted work, approval rejection and
   cancellation while queued finish the durable command as rejected before
   terminal delivery, while retaining the run lease until the terminal outbox
   event commits, so lookup and exact replay cannot remain pending and recovery
   cannot race the delivery handoff. Rejecting the command does not itself
   terminalize the run; the fenced `complete()` transition remains the single
   authority that records the terminal outcome and creates its outbox event.
   A queue-drain policy exception or returned rejection uses this same handoff:
   it retains the command claim, records the rejection, installs live batch
   routing context before the event becomes claimable, and then commits and
   delivers the terminal event. Any winning drainer attaches the stable event
   identity to that live context before invoking a callback, so a deferred
   destination can record and later settle its acknowledgement debt.
   Policy failures before task ownership also roll back provisional manager
   registration, capacity, and stagger state before this terminal handoff.
   A legacy queued entry has no durable fence, so the timer synthesizes and
   announces its terminal rejection instead of re-raising after dequeue.

### Tool Approval Cascade

When a subagent's tool call triggers `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST`, approval
is decided in strict priority order:

1. **Hook deny** — `hooks.on_tool_call()` returns `TOOL_DENY` → reject
2. **Hook auto-approve** — `hooks.on_tool_call()` returns `TOOL_AUTO_APPROVE`
   (the `auto_approve_tools` globs / read-only allowlist — a grant made by
   program NAME), honoured only after `name_grant.refusal_for_event(event)`
   confirms each program name in the shell command still resolves to the
   program it appears to name. A refusal DOWNGRADES to rungs 3–5 (never a hard
   block) and is audited as `outcome=auto_approve_declined` with
   `reason=name_grant`, the refusal code, and `tier=hook_auto_approve`. This
   matters most here: the subagent surface runs unattended, so an unverified
   shadowed name would be honoured with nobody watching. On Windows the check
   cannot model the shell's lookup at all, so it declines every name-based
   shell grant there — a headless subagent (no parent `auto` policy, no
   interactive approver) then rejects shell tools its allowlist used to grant.
3. **Parent policy** — `parent_policy == "auto"` → auto-approve. Resolved once
   at `_run_inner` start (see the chain below); an active global YOLO folds
   into this snapshot rather than being re-read per event.
4. **Interactive callback** — `on_tool_approval` (races dashboard + Slack, 2h timeout)
5. **Deny by default** — none of the above matched → reject

`parent_policy` is resolved once when `_run_inner` starts, using this chain:
1. Read from parent session via `get_approval_policy(parent_session_key)`
2. If empty and YOLO mode active → `"auto"`
3. If still empty **and subagent has no parent session key** → use the cached `KiroCrewConfig.agent.approval_mode` (snapshotted at `SubagentManager` init); if `"auto"` → `"auto"`

Step 3 ensures parentless subagents (e.g. cron jobs) respect the user's
global approval mode instead of falling through to interactive approval.

**Child-fidelity gate.** A child-origin permission event whose SECURITY context
is absent (`AcpEvent.child_low_fidelity`: structured params never reached the
tool_call cache, unresolved shell classification, or a shell without a
recoverable command) skips steps 2–3 and is handed to the interactive callback
with an "UNVERIFIED child request" annotation (headless: rejected), because
every field a shortcut would judge is agent-authored. One carve-out: when the
event's canonical MCP identity IS verified (`child_mcp_identity_trusted` — the
`_meta.kiro` server/tool pair resolved from the tool_call cache, carrying the
explicit `mcp_identity_trusted` provenance flag those cache hits set, resolved
non-shell; the shape a remote MCP server produces by streaming empty
`rawInput`), the **unconditional** `parent_policy == "auto"` grant still
auto-approves — the call site reads the hoisted
`AcpEvent.child_unconditional_grant_eligible` property: its decision consumes
no agent-authored event data, only the
arguments remain unverified. The hook auto-approve (title-pattern-matched) and
every content-matching path stay fail-closed on the composite fidelity.

The `is_yolo()` read happens once, when `parent_policy` is resolved at
`_run_inner` start — a YOLO toggle mid-execution takes effect on the next
subagent run, not on the current run's remaining tools.

### `cancel_all() -> None`
Cancels all running subagents, stops the reaper loop and command-authority lease
tasks, and awaits their cleanup. Handles `CancelledError` gracefully — sessions
released, count decremented.

### `steer_run(agent_id, message) -> (ok, detail)` / `follow_up_run(agent_id, message) -> (ok, detail)`
Two delivery modes for `spawn_steer` (REST `POST /api/spawn/{id}/steer`, body `mode`: `"interrupt"` default / `"follow_up"`). `steer_run` injects into the RUNNING turn via the provider's `steer`, with a bounded startup-grace poll for a live run whose session has not registered yet (#1113). `follow_up_run` never interrupts: it queues the message on `SubagentInfo.pending_followups` and arms a one-per-run watcher (`_deliver_followups`, registered in the manager-owned `_followup_watchers` dict — NOT the global `_safe_fire` set — because a watcher can spawn a brand-new run and must therefore be reachable by `cancel_all()`, per the same containment contract as `_schedule_cancel_recovery`; `cancel_all` cancels watchers BEFORE the run tasks so none can dispatch into a shutting-down gateway, and the watcher re-checks `_shutting_down` before dispatch). The watcher waits for the run to complete (`info.done` AND its task popped from `_tasks`, so teardown is finished), then dispatches the whole queue as ONE `continue_conversation` on the run's own conversation (messages joined in arrival order — three corrections cost one continuation, not three). The continuation is a normal new run on the same parent session, so its result arrives as a separate completion event. OUTCOME-AWARE: a run the user explicitly STOPPED (`user_stopped`) suppresses dispatch (`followup_suppressed` audit) — resurrecting killed work is the opposite of "the correction can wait"; error/timeout terminals still dispatch (the continuation carries the conversation's context, so "fix what broke" is legitimate). NEVER SILENT: every undeliverable path (suppressed, watcher expiry, dispatch failure) announces a SYNTHETIC failure completion event through the normal `_on_done` path, because the spawn_steer reply promised the parent an event — `followup_expired`/`followup_failed`/`followup_suppressed` SEL audits alone would leave the parent blocked on an event that never comes. Deliberately a per-run poller, NOT a hook in `_run`'s 3-guard finalization: completion is reached from many terminal paths (normal/error/timeout/cancel-recovery/reaper) and a watcher observes the outcome without adding an obligation to any of them. Bounded everywhere: poll cadence 2s, hard deadline `default_timeout + 300s`, and residual `conversation_busy` after done gets a bounded retry. Typed refusals mirror steer: `not_found`, and `not_running` (use `spawn_continue` directly on a finished run).

### Properties
- `running -> list[SubagentInfo]` — currently running agents
- `count -> int` — number of running agents
- `max_concurrent -> int` — capacity limit

## SubagentInfo

```python
@dataclass
class SubagentInfo:
    id: str               # 8-char hex UUID
    task: str             # original task text
    started: float        # time.time() at spawn
    done: bool            # True when finished (success or error)
    result: str           # LLM response text (trimmed to completion_keep for the event)
    result_path: str      # ~/.kiro/crew/subagents/<id>/result.txt (full transcript)
    result_truncated: bool  # completion copy dropped content → event carries summary+path
    error: str            # error message if failed
    elapsed: float        # seconds from start to completion (set in _run finally)
    tool_count: int       # observed tool calls (incl. auto-approved); drives running-card progress
    last_activity: float  # time.time() of last stream event; reset to _exec_started; drives idle-stall
    stalled: bool         # reaper flagged this subagent as idle/stalled (UI signal)
    _awaiting_approval: bool  # blocked on a human tool-approval prompt → exempt from idle-stall
```

## Session Lifecycle

1. `spawn()` increments `_running_count`, creates asyncio task
2. `_spawn_with_approval()` (non-YOLO): re-checks YOLO, requests approval with 2-min timeout
3. `_run()` wraps `_run_inner()` with `asyncio.wait_for(_TIMEOUT_SECS)`
4. `_run_inner()` resolves `parent_policy` (parent session → YOLO fallback → config fallback), creates session `subagent:{id}` via `SessionManager.get_or_create(approval_policy=parent_policy)` — policy is persisted on the new session
5. Streams through ACP with context injection, tool approval cascade, and turn counting
6. On completion (in `_run` finally block): fire `subagent_done` WS event immediately (before slow reset + on_done), then `sessions.release()` → `_running_count -= 1` → `sessions.reset()` → call `on_done` callback
7. On timeout: `error = "Timed out after 30 minutes"`
8. On turn limit: `error = "turn_limit:{turn_limit}"` (default 100)
9. On `CancelledError`: three-way, by cancellation source (see **Terminal-State Contract** below) — user stop → neutral `user_stopped` record (NO error); shutdown / spent one-shot → `error = "cancelled"`; any other (unexpected) cancel → one-shot auto-continue via `_schedule_cancel_recovery`

**Early WS event firing**: `subagent_done` WS event is fired in the `_run` finally block BEFORE the slow `reset()` + `on_done()` path. This ensures the dashboard receives completion status within seconds, not 30-90s later when `stream_and_collect` finishes processing.

## Terminal-State Contract (stopped vs failed vs completed)

A record's terminal outcome is three-way, with a **single canonical source**: the `SubagentInfo.outcome` property (`"stopped" | "failed" | "completed"`). Every `subagent_done` emission (live, `_run` finally, `_force_reap`, WS reconnect replay managed + native), `native_subagent_snapshots`, the `/api/spawn` listing, and tombstones carry `outcome` explicitly. Consumers MUST use `outcome` — never re-derive from `error`-nullability (the legacy `error ? failed : completed` idiom misreports a stopped agent as completed). `stopped`/`error` remain on the wire for compatibility:

| Outcome | Record shape | UI/consumer meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `stopped` | `user_stopped=True`, `error` **unset** | neutral: user killed it; partial result preserved; NOT a success, NOT a failure |
| `failed` | `error` set | failure (tombstoned, counted in Stats) |
| `completed` | neither | success |

- A user stop is neutral **in the record itself**: `cancel()` sets `user_stopped=True` and neither it nor `_force_reap` ever synthesizes an `error` for it.
- Every emission carries the flag explicitly: live `subagent_done` events, the `_run` finally emit, `_force_reap`'s emit, WS **reconnect replay** (managed and native), `native_subagent_snapshots`, and the `/api/spawn` listing all include `stopped`. Cancelling a native card persists `stopped` on the slot tracker record so replay reconstructs it as stopped.
- The gateway completion consumer (`_subagent_done`) classifies three-way: a stopped agent is announced as "stopped by user ⏹" with partial output flagged, and in orchestrator mode records **neither** `record_success` nor `record_failure`.
- **Intentional-cancel rule**: every code path that cancels a subagent task on purpose MUST set a terminal marker first — `cancel()` → `user_stopped`, `cancel_all()` → `_shutting_down`, `_force_reap` → `reaped`. An unmarked cancel is treated as unexpected and recovered once (below). Enforced MECHANICALLY, not by convention: all in-module intentional cancels route through the `_cancel_task_intentionally(task, info, reason=...)` chokepoint, which verifies a marker is visible before cancelling (a missing marker logs an error and consumes the recovery budget defensively so a mis-marked cancel can never zombie-respawn), and a source-scan test asserts no raw `.cancel()` on a managed run task exists outside the chokepoint.

## Transient Retry (mid-stream 5xx)

`_run_inner` streams through `_stream_with_transient_retry`, mirroring the main path's retry ladder: transient backend errors (the `-32603` class, per `acp_error_is_transient`) are retried with exponential backoff on the same live session; each retry fires a `subagent_retrying` WS event (chip shows `⟳ retrying`) and a SEL audit record. **Replay-safety**: if ANY activity was observed (text chunk, approved tool turn, or auto-allowed tool call), the retry sends `_TRANSIENT_CONTINUE_MSG` instead of the original prompt — a mutating tool may have executed before the first text chunk, and replaying the full prompt would re-run it. **Budget**: `TRANSIENT_RETRIES` applies only while ZERO activity was observed (replaying the bare prompt is side-effect-free); after any activity, recovery is ONE-SHOT — exactly one continuation turn, matching the main path's `_posttoken_retry_used` rule, since each post-activity continuation is an independent opportunity to repeat a side effect. The two ladders (this one and `dashboard/chat_runner.py`'s) are intentionally-identical copies cross-referenced in both sources; a change to either's predicate or budget must be mirrored. Non-transient errors and exhausted budgets propagate to the generic error arm.

## Unexpected-Cancel Recovery (one-shot auto-continue)

An unmarked `CancelledError` (see intentional-cancel rule) triggers `_schedule_cancel_recovery`: exists for cancellations arriving from outside the manager's lifecycle (parent task-tree teardown around a live subagent), mirroring the main path's PR #173 recovery. Mechanics:

- **Side-effect gate**: recovery fires ONLY when `tool_count == 0`. The respawn runs on a fresh session with no ledger of prior tool calls, so once any tool has executed the model cannot verify which side effects already happened — the run is finalized instead (error `"cancelled (auto-continue suppressed: tools already executed …)"`, partial output preserved and delivered). Text-only activity is safe to resume.
- One-shot: gated by `info._cancel_retry_used`; the recovered run's own cancel is terminal.
- Explicit handshake: `_resume` awaits the ORIGINAL task's full teardown (session release/reset, slot decrement, registry pop) before respawning — never a timed sleep.
- Slot re-acquisition: waits (bounded, `_RECOVERY_SLOT_WAIT_SECS`) for free capacity; the slot claim and `create_task` are ATOMIC (no await between) so a concurrent `_drain_queue` cannot overshoot `max_concurrent`.
- Shutdown-reachable: the pending `_resume` task is registered in `_tasks` under `"{id}:recovery"` so `cancel_all()` cancels it; a cancelled recovery finalizes the record terminally and never respawns.
- Failed recovery (no slot / teardown timeout) still fully finalizes: `subagent_done` emitted, tombstoned, delivered via `on_done`.
- Replay-safety at respawn: when the first attempt streamed partial text, the respawned prompt is prefixed with `_CANCEL_RESUME_PREFIX` so the model continues instead of restarting (the prefix also gates on `tool_count` as defense-in-depth, though the side-effect gate above means a tool-activity run never reaches respawn). A bare original prompt is re-sent only for a zero-activity first attempt.

## Reaper Loop

`start_reaper()` launches a periodic loop (60s interval) that force-kills subagents exceeding the 30-minute timeout deadline. Defense-in-depth for cases where `asyncio.wait_for` fails to fire due to event-loop saturation or orphaned tasks.

- `_reaper_loop`: sweeps every 60s, calls `_force_reap` on expired agents
- `_force_reap`: reset with 30s timeout → SIGKILL fallback → mark done → fire `subagent_done` WS event
- **Terminal completion is arbitrated by FOUR separate guards, not by `reaped` alone.** Two paths can finish a subagent — `_force_reap` and `_run`'s `finally` — and between them there are four distinct one-time concerns. Earlier revisions tried to arbitrate them with `reaped` plus `done` and every attempt satisfied two while breaking a third (duplicate delivery when the marker was set late; a lost outcome when it was set early and the reaper was cancelled; a lost outcome when the claim was handed back to a run that had already exited; and finally **no reporter at all plus a leaked concurrency slot** when the report claim was gated on `not info.done`). The guards are now:
  1. **`info.reaped` — classification.** Was this a deliberate reap? The cancel-recovery scheduler reads it, and the marker MUST precede the intentional cancel (see the intentional-cancel rule above) or an unexpected-cancel respawn fires on the run being killed. Unchanged.
  2. **`if not info.done` — the terminal RECORD.** Error synthesis, failure stat, tombstone, cost. First-arrival-wins, so it is never written twice (pinned by `test_subagent.py::TestOnDoneTimeout::test_force_reap_skips_tombstone_when_already_done`).
  3. **`_release_slot(info)` — SLOT accounting.** A one-shot token per `SubagentInfo`; the winner decrements `_running_count` once and drains the queue. Deliberately independent of both flags above: inferring slot ownership from `done` or `reaped` produced a double decrement in one interleaving and none at all in another. A leaked slot permanently starves the spawn queue, which matters far more at the 60-100 concurrent agents the scale work targets. The cancel-recovery respawn **re-arms** this token when it re-admits a slot (`_running_count += 1`), because the respawned run occupies a fresh slot and needs its own release.
  4. **`_claim_finalize(info)` — REPORT ownership** (`subagent_done` + the `_on_done` injection, plus wave-digest settling and the result.txt TTL bookkeeping). Granted to exactly one caller; contains no `await` so the check-and-set is atomic on the loop. It does **not** consult `info.done` — that was the last defect. It returns False while `_recovering` *without consuming itself*, so a pending respawn is not reported done and its respawned run can claim later.
- **A claimed report is atomic, not merely exclusive.** The claim alone still lost outcomes when the claimer was cancelled mid-report. `_report_terminal` therefore runs on a strongly-referenced task under `asyncio.shield`, spawned by `_run` **before** its teardown awaits so the task is already live wherever a cancellation lands; the caller still receives `CancelledError` while the report completes. Synthetic batch terminals are lifecycle-owned at the synchronous scheduling site and always attempt their coordinator commit even after shutdown begins; only post-commit delivery retries stop at shutdown. Keyed rejection reports use the same shielded ownership, so shutdown cannot cancel their coordinator commit before durable state exists. `cancel_all()` drains outstanding reports with a bounded timeout and then **cancels and gathers** any straggler, so none is left invoking `_on_done` against tearing-down state or killed by a closing loop. Because the awaiter is shielded, shutdown is bounded by that drain rather than the `_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT` injection cap. Enforced by `test_subagent_reap_race.py` and the coordinator delivery regressions.
- **An undelivered report abandoned at shutdown is made RECOVERABLE, not silently dropped.** The terminal record — including the tombstone — is written before delivery is attempted, and a tombstone is exactly what `list_orphans()` uses to EXCLUDE a folder from the next start's reconciliation. So cancelling a still-pending report at the drain deadline would leave an outcome that was never injected *and* invisible to the only path that could still inject it. `cancel_all()` therefore calls `clear_tombstone(id)` for each report it cancels, re-admitting that agent to the next start's orphan reconciliation (which finds `result.txt` and re-delivers). Extending the drain to `_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT` instead was rejected: it would hold gateway shutdown for up to 20 minutes on one wedged injection, which is the exact failure the bounded drain exists to prevent. Only reports cancelled **before** `_on_done` returned are re-admitted — `info._reported_to_parent` is set the moment the injection returns, so a cancellation in the later teardown/tombstone waits cannot cause a duplicate delivery on restart.
- **Every reporter goes through the claim — including cancel-recovery failure.** There are more terminal paths than the two obvious ones: when a cancel-recovery respawn cannot happen, its `except` arm also finalizes the agent. That site previously fired `subagent_done` and `_on_done` directly, gated only on `done`/`reaped`, so a reaper racing a failed respawn delivered the outcome twice. It now takes `_claim_finalize` like every other reporter and reports through the shielded helper (which matters because `_force_reap` cancels that very task). `_resume_guarded`'s CancelledError arm writes only the RECORD and deliberately never reports — during shutdown the drain owns delivery.
- **The reaped marker and the recovery cancel precede every `await` in `_force_reap`.** Both used to sit after the session teardown, which yields for up to `_RESET_TIMEOUT` (longer on the SIGKILL path). A recovery task whose bounded handshake expired inside that window observed `reaped == False` and respawned the run being killed — tools executing after a user Stop, strictly worse than a duplicate report.
- **Delivery bookkeeping trails teardown.** Spawning the report ahead of teardown opens a window the older ordering did not have: writing the "delivered" tombstone before the session is torn down would hide a surviving child from orphan reconciliation if the process died in between. The report therefore waits on a `teardown_done` event (set in `_run`'s `finally`, so it fires even under cancellation, and bounded so the report can never wedge) before marking delivery. A reaped or recovery-failed member still settles its **siblings'** digest holds, since those siblings' results did reach the parent even though this member's did not. On the dashboard routes the report's own settle and `mark_delivered` are no-ops by design: `_subagent_done` defers the delivery bookkeeping — the completed member's own tombstone AND any held wave siblings — to the parent's CONSUMPTION of the announce via `_defer_queued_delivery` (the #4839 content-keyed slot ledger + `_delivery_queued`), on the queue branch settled by the drain and on the direct-injection branch by `_arm_queued_delivery_settlement` armed on the injection task (#2233). A bare `_on_done` return is a local routing success, not evidence the parent received anything; an unconfirmed hand-off leaves the debt parked and orphan-recoverable rather than tombstoned.
- `_sigkill_session`: best-effort SIGKILL when graceful reset hangs
- After decrementing `_running_count`, `_force_reap` calls `_drain_queue()` so the freed slot immediately starts a queued spawn. Normal completion pumps the queue via its `finally` block, but that block is gated on `not info.reaped`; a reap sets `reaped=True` and decrements the count itself, so without this explicit drain a queued spawn would sit stranded until an unrelated agent finished or a new spawn arrived.
- Wired up in `gateway.py` after `SubagentManager` init

### Idle-Stall Detection

The main-agent watchdog stack (`tool_stall_suspect`) does **not** govern subagents; `_maybe_flag_stall(agent_id, info, now)` (called from the reaper sweep) is their equivalent. It does, however, consult the *same* liveness oracle (`acp/liveness.py`) — see the attribution note below. Each **session-scoped** stream event calls `_touch_activity(info)`, which updates `info.last_activity`, clears a prior `stalled` flag (re-emitting `subagent_stalled {stalled: false}` when work resumes), retires the agent's oracle and bumps `info._stall_gen`. `info.last_activity` is (re)initialised to `_exec_started` at the top of `_run_inner` so a queue / spawn-approval wait is never counted as idle.

Event kinds are NOT the discriminator: the same `EVENT_SUBAGENT_LIST` also reaches a session through the routed KAS sub-agent lifecycle path (`_handle_kas_subagent`, off a `session/update` frame), where it IS that session's own progress -- excluding by kind would falsely badge a working KAS agent. Provenance is carried instead: `AcpRuntime._reader_loop` sets `JsonRpcMessage.fanout_no_owner` when it fans an ownerless frame out to MORE THAN ONE registered session (a lone session is the sole owner, so it stays unmarked), the dispatch loop copies that onto `AcpEvent.runtime_global`, and `_run_inner` skips the refresh only for a `runtime_global` event. Everything else stays fail-open: an event kind the dispatch switch does not special-case still counts as activity, so a new session-scoped kind can never invent a false stall.

Why the exclusion exists: `_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update` carries no `sessionId`, so the runtime broadcasts it to *every* session queue, and under `agent.session_sharing` one roster notification lands on every co-tenant subagent's stream. Counting it as activity refreshed `last_activity` for a whole batch of wedged subagents at the same instant and cleared their badge, so the badge flapped and the reported `idle_secs` measured time since an unrelated agent's roster churn (`#4841`; the plateau measured in `#2854`).

Per sweep, for an agent that has actually started (`turns > 0` or a live `_pid`) and is **not** blocked on a human approval prompt (`_awaiting_approval`):
- `idle > _stall_idle_secs` and not already flagged → consult liveness (below), and unless the verdict clears it, set `info.stalled = True`, emit `subagent_stalled {stalled: true, idle_secs}` (surface-only; the card shows a "no activity" warning), and append a record of the slow command to `~/.kiro/crew/subagents/slow_commands.jsonl` for later analysis (rotated at 1 MiB keeping one previous generation, `.jsonl.1`, so total disk stays bounded at ~2 MiB; a reader wanting full available history must consume both generations).
- Detection is **surface-only**: `_maybe_flag_stall` never terminates the agent. A genuinely-hung subagent is closed by the user from the UX (per-row stop → `spawnDelete` → `SubagentManager.cancel(agent_id)`, or header Stop-all). The wall-clock reaper at `_TIMEOUT_SECS` remains the only automatic terminator; a `DEAD` liveness verdict deliberately does **not** escalate to a kill, because that would be a change to reap semantics rather than to the signal.

#### Liveness attribution (why idle time alone is not the detector)

Idle time cannot separate a wedged tool call from a slow, silent one, so the flag is gated on a liveness verdict. Attribution is per-CHILD, not per-runtime-PID: the subagent event loop records the in-flight tool's dispatch snapshot (`_inflight_tool` — the trusted `is_shell`, the command, `tool_name`, dispatch time, taken from the same `AcpEvent` the main agent's `ToolCallState` is built from), and `_stall_verdict` hands it to a per-agent `LivenessOracle`. With `is_shell` set this takes the oracle's shell-child branch, which cmdline-matches a live descendant and then tracks that pid.

This is what makes the verdict meaningful even though **session-sharing subagents share the parent's runtime PID**: the match keys on the command, not the runtime. A whole-subtree aggregate would be useless here — it is dominated by kiro-cli's own background socket/keepalive traffic, so a `sleep`-only subagent reads as "working".

Verdict → action:
- `WORKING` — an attributable live child, so the agent is progressing: **not** flagged (suspicion stays open so the badge appears as soon as that child stops).
- `DEAD` / `STUCK_INPUT` — positive evidence of a wedge, so it flags **immediately**, skipping the two-sweep confirmation that exists to dampen guesses. That skip is **withdrawn whenever the runtime is session-shared** (see the third bound below), because the trust it assumes is exactly what a shared runtime removes — the parent session is always a co-tenant of that process, so a lone subagent is no safer than one with siblings.
- `UNKNOWN` — no attributable evidence (no tool in flight, a non-shell tool with no child to match, unreadable `/proc`, or a refused executor): falls back to idle-time-only with two-sweep confirmation.

Four bounds keep this honest, and each exists for a failure that was observed rather than imagined:

- **`_SUPPRESS_CEILING`** — a `WORKING` verdict only suppresses while `idle < _stall_idle_secs * _SUPPRESS_CEILING`. Attribution is not infallible: two siblings running *similar* commands under `session_sharing` can cmdline-match the same child, so a wedged agent could read `WORKING` for as long as its sibling's child lives. Unbounded that would convert a case the idle-time-only path DID badge into a permanent false negative — worse than a spurious badge, since the badge is self-clearing and a missing one is not. Past the ceiling the badge wins, so misattribution costs latency, not the signal.
- **The wedged skip is withdrawn under a shared runtime.** The same fallible match runs in the other direction: a `DEAD` reading can describe *another session's* child that exited, and because `DEAD`/`STUCK_INPUT` normally bypass the two-sweep confirmation, that would raise an immediate badge on a healthy agent — defeating the dampening that keeps the badge trustworthy at 60-100 agents. Granting one path immediate trust in a signal the ceiling exists because it is unreliable is incoherent, so when `info._session_sharing` is set the wedged verdict earns its badge the same way a guess does: by holding across two sweeps (~60s). **The gate keys on the flag, not on a sibling count.** `_create_shared_session` puts the subagent on the **parent's** AcpRuntime — one process hosts everything — so `info._pid` is the parent's process and the parent's own tool children are descendants of it too. `_live_shared_count` iterates the subagent registry and therefore cannot see the parent, so an earlier `_live_shared_count(pid) > 1` form left a *lone* session-shared subagent on the fast path while it could still cmdline-match the parent's child and flag the instant that child exited. Since a shared runtime always contains the parent, "could this match belong to someone else?" holds for every session-sharing agent; only a dedicated-process subagent (`session_sharing` false, or a per-spawn model/effort override that forces its own process) keeps the immediate flag.
- **The walk is offloaded, never inline.** `check_tool` is a synchronous `/proc` walk (`iter_descendants`, plus `os.readlink` on `/proc/<pid>/fd/*`, which can block on the very wedged fd being investigated) and the reaper runs on the same event loop that serves every chat turn. It is submitted through **`consult_offloaded` (`acp/liveness.py`) — the one shared guard, not a local mirror of it**: the same helper the main-agent watchdog reaches via `AcpSessionHandle._consult_oracle_offloaded`, so `SubagentInfo` supplies the `_consult_future` its `ConsultFutureHolder` protocol requires and a fix to the guard lands on every caller at once. The guard owns submission-inside-the-guard, exception retrieval attached at submission, the bound (`OFFLOADED_CONSULT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, 10s) via `wait_for(shield(...))`, at most **one outstanding walk per holder** so a permanently wedged read cannot leave a new blocked worker behind on every sweep, and degrade-to-`UNKNOWN` on any failure. Failure mode to be aware of: consults are awaited serially within a sweep, so if many agents cross the idle threshold while their `/proc` reads wedge, a single sweep can stretch toward N×10s and delay the wall-clock reap for the other agents in it. Bounded and unlikely (one walk per agent, later sweeps short-circuit on the in-flight guard), but it is the cost of doing this in the sweep rather than out of band.
- **Generation counter.** The awaited verdict is discarded (`superseded mid-consult`) when `info._stall_gen` moved during the walk — i.e. activity, a final tool result, or the next dispatch retired the snapshot it was submitted for. Without this the walk's own latency is enough to flag an agent that has resumed working, and `DEAD`/`STUCK_INPUT` skip two-sweep dampening, so a stale one would flag instantly.

The snapshot is retired only on a **`tool_final`** result. `EVENT_TOOL_RESULT` is also emitted for non-completed progress updates (`_dispatch` sets `tool_final = status == "completed"`), and treating one of those as the end of the tool would drop attribution mid-command — degrading exactly the long silent command this detection exists to judge. `acp.client` gates on the same field. On each retirement the oracle is replaced via `fresh()` rather than mutated, so a walk still running against the previous command cannot write its late sample into the next tool's baseline.

The verdict and its evidence are recorded in the reaper's log line but are deliberately **not** on the `subagent_stalled` wire: no consumer reads them today (the frontend narrows the payload on arrival and the coalesced batch update forwards only `stalled`), and the event is app-sdk-forwarded, so unread keys would become semi-permanent surface.


The slow-command record (`record_slow_command`, `subagent_persistence.py`) is append-only and deliberately NOT a tombstone: a tombstone marks an agent dead and is consumed by orphan-reconciliation / TTL cleanup, whereas a stalled subagent is still running. Fields: `id`, `flagged` (ts), `last_tool` (redacted), `tool_count`, `turns`, `idle_secs`, `elapsed_secs`, `parent_session`, `session_sharing`.

`_awaiting_approval` is set around the human tool-approval await in the `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST` branch (reset in `finally`, which also refreshes `last_activity`), so a slow approval never looks stalled.

### Running-card progress events

`subagent_tool` is fired on **`EVENT_TOOL_CALL`** (not only `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST`) — kiro-auto-allowed tools surface only as informational `tool_call` updates, so this is the sole progress signal a simple/read-only task emits. Payload carries `{tool, tool_kind, turns, tool_count}`; `info.tool_count` increments per observed tool call. The `subagent_snapshot` reconnect payload (`dashboard/ws.py`, built by `build_subagent_snapshot()`) also carries `tool_count`, `stalled`, and — only while stalled — `idle_secs`, recomputed at replay time from `last_activity` (clamped at 0, omitted entirely for a healthy agent) so a reloading client recovers progress/stall state including the span that justifies the stall badge (a transition-only WS signal always needs a matching snapshot field).


### Model Provenance (#3582)

Every subagent card names the model the run actually ran on, so a model-pinned
review's real model is auditable. `SubagentInfo` carries two fields: `requested_model`
— the EFFECTIVE pin, i.e. the per-spawn `model` OR, when empty, the
`agent.role_models['subagent']` config pin (AGENTS.md's documented way to pin a
subagent model), resolved once at spawn; `"auto"` when completely unpinned (no
per-spawn model, no role pin) — and `resolved_model`, the id the live
session actually served, read via the provider's public `served_model` accessor
(`_resolved_model_of`, which normalizes the `DEFAULT_MODEL` "auto" sentinel to `""`
= unknown). `resolved_model` is captured at spawn (ACP reports it immediately) and
refreshed on the first text chunk (covers the CC path); a known value is never
clobbered back to `""`.

The resolved id rides the wire as a `model` field on the `subagent_spawn`,
`subagent_done`, and reconnect `subagent_snapshot` payloads, and the requested pin
rides alongside it as a `requested_model` field on those same payloads (both are
`_redact()`-ed, since the pin is caller-supplied). The single-completion
meta (`subagent_completion_meta.single_completion_meta`, mirrored by
`website/src/pages/chat/subagentCompletion.ts`) additionally carries `requestedModel`
and `resolvedModel`. The frontend renders the resolved model as a chip beside the
agent pill and flags a **downgrade** — an amber chip plus a persistent
`role="status"` "Requested X, served Y" banner — when the two name different models,
on BOTH the completion card AND the **live** Subagents-panel row (`ActivityViewer`),
so a mis-pinned run is visible mid-flight, not only at completion. Because the pin
rides `subagent_done` (and its reconnect replay), a downgraded run that completes
before a reconnect rehydrates its card with the amber flag intact. For unpinned
spawns `requested_model="auto"` records the sentinel so the frontend shows a neutral
chip rather than hiding the column. "Same model" is decided by the shared
`normalizeModelKey`
(`website/src/lib/model.ts`, mirroring the backend `_normalize_model_key`): dotted vs
dashed spellings and case fold, and `auto`/`default` fold to "no pin", so an honored
pin whose wire spelling differs does not false-flag. Wave-digest completions
(`wave_chunk_meta`/`wave_final_meta`) carry no structured model field, but each
member's **served** model is surfaced inline in the digest body
(`ok_lines`/`fail_lines`) that both the parent LLM and the card already read —
`— \`id\` ✅ task · model <served>` — so batch members are auditable for which
model actually ran. Only the served id is shown (no requested/downgrade
qualifier): a raw requested-vs-resolved inequality is not the card's downgrade
fold and would false-amber every member of a normal `auto`-pinned wave, so the
amber-downgrade signal stays a single-completion concern until this shares the
card's fold (or #5339's registry fold). The value is redacted through the
display context before it enters the broadcast digest text.
## Completion Injection

Subagent results are routed back to the **originating session** via
`_subagent_done` in `gateway.py`. The `parent_session_key` on `SubagentInfo`
tracks which session spawned the subagent.

### Two-Level Timeout

| Timeout | Location | Duration | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Outer cap | `subagent.py _run()` | 1200s (20 min) | Semaphore wait + injection combined |
| Inner cap | `gateway.py _subagent_done()` | 900s (`INJECTION_TIMEOUT`, tunable via `KIROCREW_INJECTION_TIMEOUT`) | Single `stream_and_collect` call |

On timeout (inner or outer):
1. Kill stuck kiro-cli process via `sessions.reset()`
2. Queue failure event into `slot._pending_subagent_failures`
3. Next `_run_chat` drains the queue into LLM context with `result_path`
4. LLM reads result from disk if needed

### Prompt-Busy Recovery

`_inject_with_retry()` in `gateway.py` makes up to 3 attempts (1 initial + 2 retries) of `stream_and_collect` on AcpError. Between retries: cancels orphaned prompt, exponential backoff. On `PromptBusyExhaustedError`: kills provider, queues failure event. Note: the 1200s outer cap (`_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT`) bounds total wall-clock time, so not all retries may fire if earlier attempts consume the budget.

**Reconnect recovery**: `subscribe_subagents` in `ws.py` restores both managed and native subagent cards. Managed subagents are authoritative in `SubagentManager`: running records replay as `subagent_snapshot`, and recently completed records replay as `subagent_done`. Managed results remain disk-backed and are not copied into inline Redux card payloads.

Native kiro-cli subagents run inside the parent ACP turn and are owned by the parent dashboard slot. `DashboardState.native_subagent_snapshots()` replays running native cards as `subagent_snapshot` and recent terminal cards as `subagent_done`. A native `subagent_done` payload may include optional `task`, `agent`, and `result` fields. `result` is a redacted output tail bounded to 8,000 characters, with an explicit truncation marker when earlier output was dropped. Running output retained for replay is bounded to 40,000 characters, with an 80,000-character hard accumulation ceiling. Terminal native records are retained globally up to 50 cards for at most one hour. The client treats `done` and `error` as monotonic terminal states, so a stale running snapshot interleaved after a live completion cannot demote the card.

**Redaction**: All subagent event payloads (running snapshots and done events) have the `agent` field redacted before sending to the dashboard. Task text is redacted before truncation to prevent credential patterns spanning the boundary.

| Parent Session | Backend Delivery | Client Follow-up | User Sees |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard (`dashboard:*`) | Append as user message + broadcast via WS | TUI/web re-injects via `sendMessage` → LLM round-trip | LLM's response summarizing the result |
| Slack (thread ts) | Post to Slack channel thread + dashboard notification | _(none — raw result posted directly)_ | Raw subagent result text |
| Non-Slack channel (`telegram:*`, `discord:*`, `unified:*`, …) | Inject into the parent ACP session, then send the synthesized reply through the governed cross-surface transport ladder (`_deliver_channel_reply` → `_resolve_channel_target` → `MessagingTransport.send_message`) + dashboard notification. Target resolution: origin link (recorded by Discord's inbound dispatch) → non-Slack mirror link (e.g. Telegram `/link`) → for **direct (1:1) sessions only**, the stored `"{namespace}:{user_id}"` channel value, resolved to a postable conversation via `transport.resolve_configured_target`. Group/forum sessions without an origin/mirror link, channels whose dispatcher records neither, and denied/unsupported egress all degrade to notification-only — never a cross-conversation send. | _(none)_ | LLM's synthesized reply in the channel conversation |
| Cron/no parent | Dashboard notification only | _(none)_ | Notification panel entry |

### Post-fan-out Synthesis Turn

After a fan-out of sub-agents, a single dedicated **synthesis turn** produces
the user-facing summary (restate goal → synthesize across all results →
recommend next actions), instead of leaving the last visible message as a
per-sub-agent completion note. Dashboard chat only (orchestrator mode has its
own stage synthesis).

- **Arm** — in `_subagent_done` (chat mode, `not _is_orchestrator`), when the
  last outstanding sub-agent for the parent completes
  (`running_agents_for(parent_key) == []`), set `slot._pending_synthesis = True`.
- **Fire** — in `chat_runner._run_chat`'s drain/idle branch, once the queue is
  empty, no agents are running, `_pending_synthesis` is set, **and**
  `slot._subagent_deliveries_inflight == 0`, launch exactly one tracked synthesis
  task. `_synthesis_inflight` prevents duplicates. There is **no readiness wait**:
  readiness is latched at gateway boot and refreshed only on explicit user action,
  so parking the arm on it would strand the synthesis indefinitely. The task
  clears the arm once the delivery guards pass, immediately before starting one
  timeout-bounded `_run_chat` turn with `SUBAGENT_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT`; a signed-out
  CLI surfaces as an `AcpAuthRequired` error card from that turn.
- **Per-result turns kept** — each completion is still processed in its own turn
  (no raw buffering) to avoid a context-window blowup; the synthesis works over
  the already-condensed per-result turns.
- **Delivery-race guard** — `_subagent_deliveries_inflight` is incremented in
  `_subagent_done` from entry until the completion is queued/launched
  (try/finally). Because a concurrently-finishing sibling holds this count while
  it awaits the current turn (busy path), an earlier turn cannot fire synthesis
  before that sibling's result is delivered.
- **Cancellation** — a real user message draining first clears
  `_pending_synthesis` (user takes over); a newer in-flight batch defers
  synthesis until it too completes (only one synthesis fires, after all work).
- **Linked surfaces** — `SUBAGENT_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT` begins with
  `SUBAGENT_SYNTHESIS_PREFIX`, marking it a synthetic continuation that is NOT
  mirrored to Slack/Telegram as a user message (only its reply is delivered).

### Parent Session Discovery

The gateway sets the `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY` env var when spawning kiro-cli,
and `mcp_core.py` reads it via `os.environ.get()`. If the env var is missing
(e.g. older gateway), it falls back to reading
`~/.kiro/crew/session_pid_{getppid()}.txt` for backward compatibility. The
session key flows through the `/api/spawn` endpoint as `parent_session`.

## Scale Plumbing (60-100 concurrent agents)

Large waves must not flood the WS socket, the parent LLM's context, or the UI. Five mechanisms — WS coalescing/replay-batching and UI caps are inert below their thresholds; digest chunking applies uniformly to every multi-task wave (single-task spawns behave byte-identical to legacy):

Delivery FIFO survives a route failure: a failed non-final chunk owns the
wave's next delivery position until its retained snapshot is accepted. Same-wave
callbacks serialize through route acceptance, so later members remain
unaccounted and retryable instead of composing or delivering the final chunk
ahead of an in-flight route. A failed one-shot deadline flush restores the live
wave snapshot and held clocks; a later forced flush or the real wave close then
owns every result that was not accepted.

- **Batch identity**: `spawn(batch_id=..., batch_total=...)` (threaded from `spawn_run tasks=[...]` — one 12-hex id per multi-task call — via `POST /api/spawn` transport params; survives the stagger queue). `spawn_batch_started {batch_id, count}` fires once per batch on its first started member; the id rides every WS frame (`base["batch_id"]`).
- **Event coalescing** (`subagent_scale.SubagentEventCoalescer`, wired in the gateway's `_subagent_event`): above 8 active agents, `subagent_tool`/`subagent_stalled`/`subagent_retrying` buffer per-agent (latest state wins, merged) and flush every ~1s as ONE `subagent_batch_update {updates:[...]}` frame to all clients; `subagent_chunk` text buffers append-concatenated (16KB/agent cap) and flushes as `subagent_batch_chunks {chunks:[...]}` to subagent subscribers only. Lifecycle events (`spawn`/`done`/`recovering`/`injection_failed`/`batch_*`) are NEVER coalesced, and a `done`/`spawn` flushes buffered state first so ordering is preserved. Non-int active-count fails open to pass-through.
- **Chunked wave-digest completion injection** (gateway `_subagent_done`): every batch member is accounted per `batch_id` (this is the single completion consumer for all terminal paths). Every multi-task wave (`batch_total > 1`) delivers results to the parent queue-style: completed members are HELD, and every `SUBAGENT_DIGEST_CHUNK_SIZE` completions (default 10, env `KIROCREW_SUBAGENT_DIGEST_CHUNK_SIZE`, clamped 1..1000) flush ONE `[Subagent batch completion event]` chunk digest — failures first with detail, successes as one-line `result_path` pointers (60KB cap per chunk); the final member flushes the remaining partial chunk. A 60-agent wave = 6 digest turns spread across the wave's runtime — bounded chunk size, incremental signal, and no straggler-gated mega-digest. Chunk buffers (`fail_lines`/`ok_lines`/`guard_msgs`/`held_delivery_ids`) reset per flush; cumulative `ok`/`err`/`stopped` counts ride the final chunk's summary. **Spawn discipline**: non-final chunks instruct the parent NOT to spawn new sub-agents while batches are still arriving; the final chunk releases the gate ("finish processing all results before spawning follow-ups") — mirrored by a line in the `spawn_run` tool description. **Chunk order is FIFO**: the injection busy-check (`_injection_slot_busy`) treats a live `slot.task` — the claim assigned synchronously at dispatch — as busy in addition to `slot.running`, so a later chunk waits behind an injection that is dispatched but still inside `bounded_chat_turn`'s off-loop timeout resolution, instead of racing ahead of it or assigning `slot.task` over the earlier chunk's still-pending task. A failed non-final chunk owns the next FIFO position only when it carries a stable coordinator outbox event that can replay it exactly. Batch rejections and lost-submission records have no worker lifecycle to create that event, so `_safe_announce` first persists each as a synthetic coordinator terminal and routes its outbox event; a failed final chunk can then be reclaimed exactly instead of losing already-held siblings when the live wave closes. Any remaining callback without a stable event restores its composed buffers to the live wave rather than becoming an unreplayable retry owner. Single-task spawns have no batch identity and keep the plain per-agent injection. A batch member rejected at spawn (empty task, low memory, cwd, governance, bad agent) is counted as submitted AND announced through the done callback with its batch identity (`_announce_rejection`) — so a rejection that closes the wave still reaches the consumer and releases held sibling results (non-batch rejections do not announce; the caller gets the error synchronously). `batch_finished {batch_id, total, ok, err, stopped}` broadcasts for every batch regardless of size. **Wave liveness (lost-submission backstop)**: a member rejected before reaching `spawn()` or lost during transport is counted in every sibling's `batch_total` but never in `submitted` — un-reconciled, the count-driven `batch_members_pending()` wedges the wave forever. Three layers close it: (1) `api_spawn` marks only rejections/capacity reached after manager admission with `counted: true` (preserved through the MCP client's error flattening); coordinator identity conflicts occur before manager admission and remain uncounted; (2) `spawn_run` best-effort POSTs `/api/spawn/lost` for each explicit UNcounted rejection, which calls `record_lost_submission` — counts the member as submitted and announces a synthetic terminal failure through the completion consumer so the wave closes; uncertain transport failures are not immediately reconciled because the gateway may have accepted them; (3) the reaper's `_sweep_stuck_waves` (every sweep) force-reconciles uncertain or lost submissions when `submitted < expected`, all registered members are terminal, nothing is queued, and no submission progress occurred for `_WAVE_STUCK_SECS` (1800s / 30 minutes — deliberately generous, symmetric with the per-agent hard ceiling) — one lost member per sweep, converging across sweeps; this also bounds the `_batch_submitted`/`_batch_progress_ts` leak. Straggler-held partial chunks are bounded by the **hold deadline** (below), not by the member's 30-minute hard ceiling.

- **Digest hold deadline (straggler escape hatch)**: both chunk triggers are event-driven — a COUNT trigger (`SUBAGENT_DIGEST_CHUNK_SIZE` pending completions) and wave close — so neither can fire while a straggler is simply *not finishing*. With the default count (10) above any wave size the concurrency cap realistically produces (2–5), the count trigger is unreachable and wave close becomes the ONLY flush: every sibling's finished result is withheld for the slowest member's entire remaining runtime, and a member that HANGS rather than fails withholds them for the full `_TIMEOUT_SECS` reap — up to 30 minutes of total silence, indistinguishable from a dead session (issue #2215). The reaper's `_sweep_digest_holds` supplies the LATENCY trigger the count lacks: when the OLDEST outstanding hold in a live wave ages past `DIGEST_HOLD_SECS` (default 120s, env `KIROCREW_SUBAGENT_DIGEST_HOLD_SECS`, clamped to `_TIMEOUT_SECS`; `0` opts back out to count-trigger-only), `force_digest_flush` announces a synthetic **flush-only** record through the single completion consumer — the same re-entry mechanism `record_lost_submission` uses, so digest composition, routing, and the held-tombstone settle contract stay in one place. The record carries the wave's `batch_id` but is NOT a member: `_digest_flush_only` makes the gateway skip every per-member side effect (terminal WS event, orchestration tracker accounting, `done`/`ok`/`err` counters, digest lines) and only force the pending chunk out. **One knob, two jobs, now split**: the count keeps bounding digest SIZE for large waves; the deadline caps worst-case delivery LATENCY at every wave size. A wave whose members all finish within the deadline of each other still delivers ONE consolidated digest, so the deliberate small-wave behavior is unchanged. The forced chunk is labelled honestly as a PARTIAL release (`k/k+1`, "N of M delivered, R still running") and tells the parent to synthesize what it has rather than keep waiting. Hold bookkeeping: the gateway stamps `_digest_held_at` when it holds a member and clears it when that member's chunk fires — deliberately separate from `_digest_held`, which is the restart-safety flag the run loop reads and which the sweep must never mutate. The sweep is skipped entirely when `batch_members_pending()` is False, so it can never race the real wave-close digest into a duplicate delivery.
Wave closure is based on accounted terminal callbacks, never live manager
membership. A completed callback can already be absent from the manager registry
while it waits behind the per-wave routing lock. Rejections and lost submissions
reach the same consumer through synthetic terminal events, with stuck-wave
recovery as the delayed backstop.

- **Reconnect replay batching** (`ws.py`): more than `SUBAGENT_REPLAY_BATCH_THRESHOLD` (8) replay frames collapse into ONE `subagent_snapshot_batch {items:[{type, data}]}` frame; the client fans items into the per-frame reducers.
- **Stall two-sweep confirmation** (`_maybe_flag_stall`): the first reaper sweep past `_stall_idle_secs` only marks `_stall_suspect_at`; the second consecutive idle sweep flags `stalled` (event + slow-command record). Any stream activity that BELONGS to the session (`_touch_activity`) resets the suspicion; a `runtime_global` frame fanned out to co-tenants does not. Adds ≤1 sweep interval (~60s) latency; prevents alarm fatigue from healthy-slow agents ambering at scale.

**Retry endpoint**: `POST /api/spawn/{agent_id}/retry` re-spawns a terminal FAILED agent's original task (never running — would double work; never user-stopped — deliberately killed; native rejected). New id, no batch identity carried (a finished wave's digest is never reopened). Backs the UI's "Retry failed (N)" control.

## Hook Integration

### PostToolUse Firing

The subagent loop fires both `PreToolUse` (on `EVENT_TOOL_CALL`) and
`PostToolUse` (on `EVENT_TOOL_RESULT`), mirroring `chat_runner.py`. The
tool name is cached on `EVENT_TOOL_CALL` by `tool_call_id` and looked up
when the result arrives. The `Running: ` prefix is stripped so both hooks
receive identical tool_name strings. Hook errors are caught at debug level
to prevent misbehaving hooks from breaking the subagent loop.

### Hook Payload Metadata

Three optional fields are passed to `ScriptHookStore.fire()` and the
`fire_tool_hooks()` wrapper when called from subagent context:

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `subagent_id` | `SubagentInfo.id` | 8-char hex ID of the firing subagent (None for parent) |
| `parent_session_key` | `SubagentInfo.parent_session_key` | Session key of the parent that spawned this subagent |
| `agent_role` | `SubagentInfo.agent` | Agent role name configured for the subagent |

All three default to `None` and are only emitted into `hook_event` when
truthy. Payloads are byte-identical for callers that do not supply them,
preserving backward compatibility for existing hook scripts.

Caller sites:
- `subagent.py`: passes all three at both `fire_tool_hooks` (PreToolUse)
  and `hook_store.fire` (PostToolUse) call sites
- `task_executor.py`: passes `session_key` and `agent` (no `subagent_id`)
- `chat_runner.py` / `llm_helpers.py`: unchanged (parent context, defaults to None)

## Skill Integration

`skills/subagent/SKILL.md` (project-level) triggers on keywords: `background`, `spawn`, `bg`, `subtask`, `parallel`, `separately`, `concurrently`. Instructs the LLM to use `kirocrew spawn "task"` via bash to spawn subagents.

### CLI: `kirocrew spawn "task"`

POSTs to `http://localhost:5476/api/spawn` (dashboard API). Returns immediately with subagent ID. Gateway runs the task async and posts result to Slack when done.

### MCP Tool: `spawn_run`

Exposed via `kirocrew-core` MCP server. Always fire-and-forget — results
are delivered back to the calling session via completion event injection.

**Single task:**
```python
spawn_run(task="search docs for X")
```

**Batch parallel:**
```python
spawn_run(tasks=["search docs for X", "check pipeline status", "review CR-123"])
```

All agents spawn at once. The tool returns immediately with agent IDs.
Results arrive as `[Subagent completion event]` messages in the session,
processed by the LLM automatically.

Parameters:
- `task` (str): single task description
- `tasks` (list[str]): multiple tasks for parallel execution
- `cwd` (str, optional): absolute path to launch subagent in. Must be under a configured `subagent_cwd_allowed_roots` entry (default: `~/workspace`, `~/workspaces`, `~/workplace`, `~/workplaces`). Validated via realpath + prefix match. Pool skipped when cwd is set. These roots are a least-privilege allowlist and are never widened automatically: a persisted list whose roots all fail to exist on the host rejects every cwd, and the operator must edit `agent.subagent_cwd_allowed_roots` (or delete the key to take the shipped default). Neither the loader nor the guard stats the configured roots.
- `max_turns` (int, optional): override tool-call budget for this spawn (default: config or 100)
- `agent` (str, optional): agent name for the subagent
- `reasoning_effort` (str, optional): per-call reasoning-effort override (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`), batch-wide like `model`. Precedence: per-call value → `agent.role_efforts['subagent']` pin → provider default; `""`/absent changes nothing. Like a model/effort role pin, a non-empty value forces the dedicated-process path (the parent's shared runtime cannot switch effort per session), so a wide fan-out pays a full process per subagent — and that cost is paid even when the resolved model turns out not to support effort (the level is then dropped at the provider factory). Carried through the stagger queue and the retry endpoint like the context-group flags. NOT inherited by `spawn_continue` — a continuation resolves effort fresh (role pin, else default), the same parity as `model`. When the requested effort cannot take effect, the gateway says so: `/api/spawn` resolves the model the factory's effort gate will see (per-call value, else the subagent role pin, else the session chain for the effective agent — a crew's own model pin, else a non-sentinel global `agent.model`; a named kiro agent's own pin resolves downstream and cannot carry the overlay) and returns an `effort_dropped` reason on the success response, which the tool renders as one attributed line per distinct verdict — subagents sharing an identical verdict (the usual case, since the value is batch-wide) are collapsed into a single line naming all of them, while differing verdicts keep their own attributed lines — including the default case where nothing is pinned and the model resolves to "auto". When the effort WILL apply, the response instead carries an `effort_applied` note naming the resolved model and the family-specific settings key (`reasoning` for GPT, `output_config` for Claude) it is delivered under, rendered the same way — so both outcomes of a requested effort are visible in the tool result. A role-pinned effort that will be dropped (no per-call effort involved) still surfaces in the gateway log at warning level, since the tool caller never asked for it — that warning is emitted by the provider factory's effort gate itself (`config/loader.py`), the single authority that drops the level, so one log line covers every surface that funnels through it (spawn, dashboard slot, cron) and cannot drift from the decision it reports on. The provider factory remains the single dropping authority; the report never rejects or alters a spawn. Per-TASK variation inside one call is deliberately not supported (see issue #2140).
- `include_memory` / `include_lessons` / `include_project` (bool, optional, default `true`): which switchable context groups the subagent inherits, applied to every task in a batch spawn. All-on is byte-identical to the injection a normal session gets, so a caller that omits them changes nothing. `include_memory=false` drops preferences, projects, daily history, semantic and episodic memory, and prior-session provenance — the normal choice for fan-out whose task text is self-contained. `include_lessons=false` additionally drops the user's learned corrections and profile, so keep it on for any subagent that writes code, edits files, or runs git. `include_project=false` drops the docs pointer and the project-directory line. It also drops the injected steering block, but ONLY on the Claude Code backend: on the ACP/kiro backend `kiro-cli --agent` loads the agent's `resources` (including steering globs) itself, which Kiro Crew cannot suppress from here, so steering still reaches an ACP sub-agent regardless of this flag. The conduct group — critical output-format rules, date, agent identity, runtime, workspace identity, and the skills index — is never switchable, because a subagent without it cannot discover its own capabilities or format what it reports back. A subagent is told by name which groups were withheld (`[CONTEXT SCOPE]`) so it reports the gap rather than guessing. Resolved once at spawn, carried through the capacity-queue round-trip and `POST /api/spawn/{id}/retry` like `approval_mode`/`silent`/`keep`. `spawn_continue` does not take the flags but does **inherit** them from the run it continues: a continuation rebuilds session context (`get_or_create` reports `is_new=True` even when it restores the session via `session/load`), so without inheritance a scoped-down run would regain a group on its follow-up turn. See `memory-skills-hooks.md` § Switchable context groups for the section-by-section mapping.

Response semantics:
- An ID means the submission was accepted. A running subagent returns its durable agent ID; capacity/stagger queueing returns a temporary `qN` receipt that is replaced by the durable ID when the queue drains. Use `spawn_list` or the completion event to discover the durable ID rather than treating the receipt as a result path.
- An explicit HTTP error response means the submission was rejected and is reported as `failed to start`; rejected work is never described as queued.
- A transport failure has unknown acceptance status because the gateway may have accepted the work before the response failed. The response warns against automatic retries and directs callers to wait and recheck `spawn_list` or completion events first. An empty immediate `spawn_list` result is inconclusive because the stagger queue is not listed. If the request was truly lost, accepted siblings may remain held until the `_WAVE_STUCK_SECS` backstop (1800s / 30 minutes) reconciles the wave.
- If every submission is explicitly rejected (with no transport uncertainty), the response states that none of the requested subagents were started and does not promise completion events or suggest polling.
- For a partial batch, accepted IDs remain paired with their tasks, rejected tasks appear in a separate failure section, and completion guidance applies only to accepted submissions.

### MCP Tool: `spawn_sub_agents`

Exposed via `kirocrew-core` MCP server. Unlike fire-and-forget `spawn_run`,
`spawn_sub_agents` is **blocking**: it spawns one or more sub-agents in
parallel, waits until all of them finish, then returns their collected
results inline to the calling tool invocation.

Each sub-agent runs as its own KiroCrew-owned ACP session (via
`SubagentManager`), so its text and tool calls stream live to the Activity
tab (`subagent_spawn` / `subagent_chunk` / `subagent_tool` / `subagent_done`
WS events) while the parent blocks.

Native kiro-cli `subagent`/`use_subagent` crews run inside the parent's
kiro-cli process rather than as KiroCrew-owned sessions. KiroCrew surfaces
those in the Activity tab too, by observing kiro-cli's sub-agent
notifications — one card per sub-agent, with each inner tool call and its
output attributed to the right card.

```python
spawn_sub_agents(agents=[
    {"agent_or_mode": "gpu-multiagent-explorer", "prompt": "list python modules"},
    {"agent_or_mode": "gpu-multiagent-explorer", "prompt": "summarize last 5 commits"},
])
```

Parameters:
- `agents` (list[dict], required): each item is `{prompt: str, agent_or_mode?: str}`. `prompt` is truncated to `MAX_MEDIUM_STRING`; `agent_or_mode` to `MAX_SHORT_STRING`. Entries with an empty prompt are skipped.
- `cwd` (str, optional): absolute path to launch all sub-agents in. Must be under a configured `subagent_cwd_allowed_roots` entry (default: `~/workspace`, `~/workspaces`, `~/workplace`, `~/workplaces`), same validation as `spawn_run`.

Blocking poll semantics:
- Each sub-agent is spawned via `POST /api/spawn` (with `parent_session`), then the handler polls `GET /api/spawn/{id}` every 2s until every sub-agent reports `done` (or `error`).
- An errored/crashed sub-agent is treated as settled so one bad agent cannot keep the loop spinning until the deadline.
- The loop pings `POST /api/session-keepalive` every 60s so the gateway's `is_responsive()` does not flag the (legitimately long-blocked) session as stale and SIGTERM the ACP subprocess mid-poll. The `wait` tool pings the same endpoint for the same reason but on a **5s** interval and with a body, because there the reply doubles as an early-end control channel (see `modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md` § Wait countdown and early end); this loop sends `{}` and ignores the reply, so 60s is sufficient.
- `max_wait` defaults to 7200s (2 hours), clamped to `[60, 7200]`, and is configurable via the `KIROCREW_SPAWN_SUB_AGENTS_MAX_WAIT` environment variable. The deadline uses `time.monotonic()`.
- Returns a newline-separated list of per-agent JSON results (`status`: `completed` / `error` / `timed_out`), all redacted for credentials and exfiltration URLs.

Difference from `spawn_run`: `spawn_run` returns immediately and delivers
results later via completion-event injection; `spawn_sub_agents` blocks and
returns the aggregated results directly, so the calling agent can reason over
them in the same turn.

## Orphan Recovery & Tombstoning

Folder-per-agent persistence at `~/.kiro/crew/subagents/{id}/`:

```
~/.kiro/crew/subagents/{id}/
  state.json      # {task, parent_session_key, started, pid}
  result.txt      # full result text (written on completion)
  tombstone.json  # {error, elapsed, timestamp} (written on failure/orphan)
```

### Gateway Restart Reconciliation

On startup, `SubagentManager` scans `~/.kiro/crew/subagents/` and reconciles:

1. **PID alive** → kill process group, deliver result if available, tombstone if not
2. **PID dead + result.txt exists** → deliver result to parent session
3. **PID dead + no result** → write tombstone with "orphaned" error

**Orphan delivery is wired** (not a stub): the gateway registers `on_orphan_notify` (session injection — rides the parent slot's batched pending-failures drain) and `on_orphan_dm` (fallback). The DM fallback collects every undelivered orphan across the reconciliation scan and sends ONE digest message (`"N subagent(s)…"`) — never N pings; a lone orphan keeps the plain per-agent message.

Legacy folder orphan scans and their identity-checked process reaping run off
the event loop; process-tree termination may invoke bounded platform tools on
Windows and must not stall gateway traffic.

### Tombstone Lifecycle

- Created on: process death without result, delivery failure, timeout (`cause` =
  `error` / `timeout` / `cancelled` / `reaped` / `gateway_restart`), **and on
  successful delivery** (`cause="delivered"`, via `mark_delivered`) so `result.txt`
  is retained for the grace window instead of deleted immediately.
- Pruned by reaper: `delivered` tombstones after `agent.subagent_result_ttl_secs`
  (default 1h); all other tombstones after 7 days. `prune_stale_tombstones` takes
  a per-cause cutoff for this.
- `spawn_status` falls back to persistence layer for completed/tombstoned agents,
  reading the retained `result.txt` (and honoring offset/limit/grep).

### MCP Tool: `spawn_status`

Retrieves a completed subagent's transcript by ID. The completion event now
carries a **summary + the `result_path`** whenever the completion copy was
truncated (`result_truncated`) or in orchestrator mode, so the parent reads the
full transcript on demand instead of re-running the subagent.

The full transcript stays in `~/.kiro/crew/subagents/<id>/result.txt` for a
**retention grace window** after delivery — on success the folder is *not*
deleted immediately; `mark_delivered` writes a `cause="delivered"` tombstone and
the reaper prunes it after `agent.subagent_result_ttl_secs` (default 3600s / 1h).
This fixes the prior day-1 bug where `delete_agent_folder` ran immediately on
delivery, so a later `spawn_status` found no file and silently fell back to the
truncated in-memory `info.result` ("truncated at the same place").

Parameters:
- `agent_id` (str, required): subagent ID from the completion event (alnum, max 64 chars)
- `offset` (int, optional): 0-based start line for a paged read (line-oriented, like reading code)
- `limit` (int, optional): max lines to return (1–2000). Omit for the full transcript.
- `grep` (str, optional): case-insensitive regex; return only matching transcript lines (offset/limit then apply to the matches)

When any of `offset`/`limit`/`grep` is set, the `/api/spawn/{id}` response
includes a `result_meta` block (`total_lines`, `matched_lines`, `offset`,
`returned_lines`, `has_more`) and the tool output is prefixed with a one-line
continuation header (`showing lines X-Y of N | more available — call again with
offset=Y`). With no paging params the full-transcript contract is unchanged. The
line split + regex run via `asyncio.to_thread` so a pathological pattern never
stalls the event loop.

### Completion Event Truncation Modes

The character cap and which end of the transcript to keep are both
configurable. Defaults preserve original behavior — opt-in to the others
when a particular agent style benefits from the change.

When truncation drops content (`SubagentInfo.result_truncated`), the completion
event is not a raw truncated blob: it carries a **first+last-words preview + the
`result_path`** (via `context_management.summarize_result`) so the parent reads
the full transcript on demand (read / grep / `spawn_status`) instead of
re-running the subagent. This is the same shape orchestrator-mode deliveries
have always used, now applied to chat mode too (gated on `result_truncated` so
small results still inline in full).

| Config key | Values | Default | Effect |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| `agent.completion_keep` | `head` / `tail` / `both` | `head` | Which end of the transcript to keep when the cap is exceeded |
| `agent.completion_keep_chars` | int (`0` disables truncation) | `3000` | Character cap applied after `completion_keep` |

The helper `apply_completion_keep(text, mode, max_chars)` lives in
`context_management.py`. `head` is identical to the earlier
behavior. `tail` is appropriate for agents that summarize at the end
(developer/reviewer/on-call). `both` keeps roughly half the budget at
each end with a middle elision marker.

Unknown `agent.completion_keep` values cause `kirocrew gateway` to fail
at startup via `_validated_completion_keep` in `config/loader.py`. The
dashboard PATCH endpoint enforces the same enum via
`_EDITABLE_CONFIG["agent.completion_keep"]`.

The values are threaded into `SubagentManager.__init__` from
`gateway.py` (`completion_keep=`, `completion_keep_chars=` constructor
kwargs sourced from `cfg.agent.*`). User-facing docs:
[`src/kiro_crew/docs/configuration.md`](../../../src/kiro_crew/docs/configuration.md),
[`src/kiro_crew/docs/subagents.md`](../../../src/kiro_crew/docs/subagents.md),
[`src/kiro_crew/docs/troubleshooting.md`](../../../src/kiro_crew/docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Dashboard API: `POST /api/spawn`

Request: `{"task": "..."}`
Response: `{"id": "abc123", "task": "...", "status": "spawned"}`
Errors: 400 (missing task), 429 (capacity reached), 503 (subagents not available)

### Handler keywords (instant, no LLM)

User-typed `spawn <task>`, `bg <task>`, `spawn list`, `spawn status` are intercepted by the handler for instant execution.

## Session sharing (shared AcpRuntime)

When `agent.session_sharing` is enabled (default **on** for the kiro backend) and
the parent session is kiro-backed, subagents no longer spawn a fresh `kiro-cli`
process each. Instead they open an additional ACP session on a **shared
`AcpRuntime`** — one process multiplexes the parent session plus all of its
subagents. Startup drops from ~3–5 s to ~200 ms and per-subagent memory from
~400 MB to near-zero.

Decision + lifecycle:

- `SubagentManager._should_use_session_sharing(info)` gates the path: config flag
  on, parent session eligible (`SessionManager.is_session_sharing_eligible`), and
  no backend-specific overrides (`model` / `allowed_tools` / `bare`).
- `_create_shared_session()` resolves the parent's `AcpRuntime` via
  `_get_parent_runtime()` (falling back to `SessionManager.get_subagent_runtime()`
  — a companion runtime), calls `runtime.create_session()`, and wraps the handle
  in `AcpSessionProvider`. `SubagentInfo._session_sharing` / `_shared_provider`
  record the shared path.
- On any failure the code falls back transparently to the legacy
  per-process path (`get_or_create`).
- Cleanup (`_run` finally + `_force_reap`) calls `_shared_provider.shutdown()` to
  tear down only the session — it never kills the shared runtime, which other
  subagents may still use. The runtime is killed when the parent session ends
  (`SessionManager.release_subagent_runtime`, invoked from `reset()`).

Non-kiro (alternate ACP backend) parents are never eligible and always use the
legacy `AcpClient` per-process path regardless of the flag.
