"""``connections_ui`` must survive load() -> masked GET -> frontend predicate.

The Connections gallery is held for a later release and is reachable only when
``connections_ui: true`` is set as a TOP-LEVEL key in the running instance's
``config.json``. The frontend reads that flag live off ``GET
/api/config/kirocrew`` (``website/src/hooks/useConnectionsUi.ts``:
``connectionsUiEnabled`` requires the value to be exactly ``true``), so the
whole feature turns on the key reaching the browser in that response body.

Nothing but a real, schema-known config value gets there. An unmodelled
top-level key is captured into ``KiroCrewConfig._extra_sections`` at load and
then dropped wholesale by ``_masked_config_dict`` — a deliberate guard, because
an edition-contributed section is absent from the schema and the sensitivity
walk cannot know which of its values are secrets. These tests pin the flag on
the modelled side of that line while keeping the guard itself intact: a
genuinely unknown key must still never reach the browser.
