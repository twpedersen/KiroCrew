    couple tests:

    * **Test-to-test leak** — a test that exercises ``/api/models`` (which calls
      ``refresh_kiro_windows``) or seeds the cache directly would otherwise leave
      entries behind, e.g. a GPT window seeded here makes a "non-registry model
      is unknown" test in another module wrongly see GPT as known.
    * **Import-time host leak** — ``model_registry`` calls ``_load_kiro_windows()``
      at import, which reads ``<config_dir>/model_windows.json``. On a developer
      box that file holds the operator's real cached windows (e.g. a locally
      served ``deepseek-3.2`` at a non-registry value), so a test asserting the
      static supplementary floor for that same id fails ONLY on that machine —
      green in CI (no such file), red locally. Snapshotting-then-restoring alone
      preserved that polluted baseline for the duration of each test body.

    Clearing before the test (and restoring the original snapshot after) makes
    every test start from the same empty cache regardless of what the host had on
    disk — so a local run matches CI. Tests that need entries seed them in their
    own body.

    The memoised message-entry builder keeps a process-global cache keyed on a
    content hash of the whole message, so two tests using the same message
    content share an entry. That is harmless while the builder is pure, and a
    silent trap the moment a test makes it impure: a test that monkeypatches
    ``chat_persistence.redact_credentials`` (or the uncached builder) and reuses
    content another test already cached is served the earlier, pre-patch entry.
    The assertion then passes against a value the patched code never produced —
    worst of all for a redaction test, which would go green having seen the
    redacted entry it was written to prove absent.

    Lives here rather than in the memoisation test module because the hazard runs
    the other way: the module that pollutes the cache is not the one that
    misreads it.

    The byte counter is part of the same state, so resetting only the dict would
    leave the memory ceiling mis-accounted and evict a healthy cache.

    The memoised config bounds are reset for the same reason: they are resolved
    once per process from whatever KIROCREW_HOME the first caller saw, so a test

    ``test_cli.py::test_real_subprocess_works_after_install_on_linux``, which on
    Linux installs a ``PidfdChildWatcher`` and runs ``asyncio.run``. On exit,
    ``asyncio.run`` detaches the watcher's loop, leaving a loop-less watcher in
    the global policy. Two distinct failures follow from that leak, and which
    one bites depends purely on xdist sharding, so adding or removing unrelated
    tests can flip a green run red with no production-code change:

    * On 3.10 the leaked watcher's ``is_active()`` is False, so the NEXT
      subprocess-spawning test fails with "asyncio.get_child_watcher() is not
      activated, subprocess support is not available".
    * On 3.12 the leaked watcher is still ATTACHED to callbacks bound to a loop
      that later closes. ``set_event_loop`` calls ``watcher.attach_loop()``,
      which reaps already-exited children and fires their callbacks -- against
      the closed loop -- raising ``RuntimeError: Event loop is closed``. Since
      pytest-asyncio calls ``set_event_loop`` when setting up every test that
      needs a loop, ONE leaked watcher fails every later test in that worker.

    The condition is therefore derived from whether the watcher API EXISTS, not
    from a version number: child watchers were only DEPRECATED in 3.12 and are
    removed in 3.14. A previous ``sys.version_info >= (3, 12): return`` guard
    skipped this cleanup on exactly the version where the second failure mode

    Computer use reads another application's accessibility tree, captures its
    window pixels, and synthesizes clicks/keystrokes into it. CI must never do
    any of that, so this is one of the TWO mechanisms that keep the native path
    unreachable in tests:

    1. this process-wide registration, so ``get_shared_backend()`` always
       returns ``FakeComputerUseBackend`` (``platform_id == "fake"``);
    2. structural — the package has no module-scope ``CDLL``/``find_library``, so
       importing it on a Linux runner loads nothing native.

    Both are asserted: ``test_computer_use_backend.py::
    test_ci_never_selects_a_native_backend`` pins (1) and
    ``test_computer_use_unsupported.py`` pins (2).

    MODULE-scoped, not function-scoped, deliberately: the registration is a
    single module-global assignment plus a singleton drop, and paying that (plus
    the ``kiro_crew.testing.fake_computer_use`` import) on all ~16k tests would
    be pure overhead. Any test that swaps the backend itself is responsible for
    restoring it (see that file's ``restore_registry`` fixture) — a

    fetch of ``official-registry.json`` on every call (#4236), and store

    any test that walks either path makes a real HTTPS request to the live

    then depends on the CI runner's network, and one transient failure also
    poisons the module's on-disk failure memory for the rest of the worker.

    Tests that want a catalog answer stub a higher seam
