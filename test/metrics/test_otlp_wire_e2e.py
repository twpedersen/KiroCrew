"""End-to-end verification that telemetry actually reaches an exporter.

Every other test in this directory collects through an ``InMemoryMetricReader``,
which proves an instrument observes but not that it *serializes*. The gap that
leaves is real: a resource attribute, an attribute value, or a temporality
setting can be correct in the SDK's in-memory view and still be wrong, dropped,
or unencodable by the time it leaves the process. These tests close it by driving
the REAL ``provider._build_recorder()`` live path and reading what an exporter
actually received.

Two tiers, because the OTLP exporter is an optional extra
(``pip install "kirocrew[otlp]"``) that a default dev/CI environment does not
have:

* **Tier 1 — serialization (always runs).** The live build's own JSONL exporter
  writes real records to disk. Asserts the full instrument roster arrives, that
  resource attributes survive with fidelity, that attribute values are the closed
  enums the modules declare, and that temporality is what each instrument kind
  requires.
* **Tier 2 — OTLP wire (skipped without the extra).** A real
  ``OTLPMetricExporter`` posts to an in-process HTTP receiver bound to loopback,
  whose protobuf body is decoded and asserted. No container, no downloaded
  binary, and no egress off the machine, so it runs anywhere the extra is
  installed.

A third tier — a genuine ``otel-collector`` process — is deliberately NOT here:
it needs a downloaded binary and cannot run in a network-isolated CI. It ships as
an opt-in script instead, ``scripts/telemetry/otlp_collector_e2e.py``, and
``docs/guides/telemetry-otlp-export.md`` documents how to run it by hand.
