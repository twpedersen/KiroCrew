"""Remediation guidance attached to a denied tool call — the "do this instead" half.

A refusal that states only WHY leaves the model to invent a way forward, and for
credential work the invention is systematically wrong in a way that costs the
user the capability entirely: the agent re-tries the same shape under a
different reader (``cat`` → ``head`` → ``python open``), each of which the same
rule family blocks, and then reports that the host has no AWS access at all.
The sanctioned path was available the whole time — nothing ever told it.

Guidance is keyed by the CLASS of thing the gate refused, not by the individual
rule. Per-rule text cannot cover the tiers that matter: an edition overlay
contributes bare fnmatch globs carrying no id, category or description, so for
exactly the rules an enterprise adds there is nothing to hang text on. The class
is instead recovered from the refusal text, whose anchor phrases every producer
in :mod:`kiro_crew.security` already shares. ``test_deny_guidance.py`` drives
those real producers rather than asserting on copied strings, so an anchor that
drifts fails there instead of silently degrading to no guidance.

The remediation prose is static, and none of it is interpolated from the command,
which is what keeps it safe to hand back to a model that may be acting on
injected content: it names the sanctioned path, never a way around the rule. The
one interpolated value anywhere in the module is the server id
:func:`credential_tool_hint` names, which comes from the host's own MCP
configuration rather than from the refused call.
