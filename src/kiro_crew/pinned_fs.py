"""Descriptor-pinned filesystem staging: open once, then never trust a name again.

Every function here exists because guarding a path by NAME does not guard the open
that follows it. A name is validated, then re-opened, and in the window between the
two anything running as this user -- which in this product includes an agent -- can
swap the final component, or an ancestor DIRECTORY, for a link pointing somewhere
else. The validated path and the opened inode are then not the same thing.

The discipline is one sentence: resolve once, open once, and address everything
downstream through the descriptor you already hold. A descriptor cannot be
re-pointed, so a component that is open is fixed; a component reached by name is
not.

Why this module exists rather than a check at each call site: two closed pull
requests (#2446, #2447) tried to add snapshot components while hardening staging in
the same change. Each review round named one more validated-by-name path use --
source root, each ancestor, each file, the destination tree, the pre-restore backup
pass -- and neither converged. The mechanism belongs in one place with one set of
invariants, and callers become thin consumers of it.

The mechanical half of this was first written for the benchmark harness in
``kiro_crew.eval.bench.safepath``, which now imports it from here. Its invariants
survived several rounds of review there and are preserved verbatim; the docstrings
explaining WHY each flag is load-bearing came with them.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT do:

* It holds no policy. It does not know which locations are protected, and it does
  not decide whether a refusal should abort a command or be reported and skipped.
  Callers pass their own refusal type (so an existing CLI error contract does not
  change) and their own ``on_skip`` reporter (so user-facing wording stays theirs).
* It does not silently substitute a weaker mechanism. Where a platform cannot pin
  (see :func:`supports_pinned_walk`), the caller is told so and decides; nothing
  here falls back to a by-name walk on its own.

    With *must_create* a name that already exists is REFUSED rather than accepted. Review
    found the hole that needs: a replace removes the live tree and stages the archive into
    its place, so if the gateway recreates that root in between, accepting it lets files
    the archive does not contain survive a "replace" that reports success. The children
    already refused a pre-existing name -- only the root was exempt, and this makes it
    consistent. Merge callers leave it false, because meeting an existing directory is
    what merging IS.

    This used to also report whether our own `mkdir` was what created the directory, so
    that the archive's mode and timestamps could be stamped on in that case only. That
    flag is gone, and the reasoning that justified it was wrong in an instructive way.

    It was correct that sampling `dst.exists()` beforehand is a name-based check with a
    window after it. What it missed is that `mkdir` succeeding does not close the window
    either: the descriptor comes from a SEPARATE `open`, so a directory replaced between
    the two leaves the flag true while describing an object the caller no longer holds --
    and the archive's metadata then lands on somebody else's directory. Review found
    that. Nothing repairs it: a stat taken after the `mkdir` observes the replacement
    just as happily, POSIX has no atomic create-and-open for a directory, and under a
    same-user threat model no mode trick helps. So the metadata is simply not applied to
    directories, and the flag has no remaining purpose.

    ``Path(p).mkdir(parents=True)`` creates every missing component by name, so a link
    already sitting at an ancestor is followed and the directories are created inside
    whatever it points at -- a write through an attacker-controlled path, which is
    strictly worse than a read through one. Review flagged the by-name creation; the
    probe that settled it showed a link AT the final component is already refused by
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` but an ancestor link is not.

    So the parent chain is pinned first and only the final component is created,
    relative to that descriptor. What remains is this module's documented and
    deliberate residual, stated in :func:`pin_parent`: a component that was already a
    link when the parent was resolved is followed by that resolution, because refusing
    every symlinked ancestor would break a destination under ``/tmp`` on macOS. The
    parent must therefore already exist -- callers create their own tree roots.

    never fires because what it finds inside the replaced tree is a plain regular
    file. Here every directory is opened ``O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTORY`` relative to its
    PARENT's descriptor and every file is opened relative to its pinned parent, so
    the directory that was validated is exactly the directory used. Both roots go

    swapped there lands the archive's bytes outside it. Caught in review.

    With *skip_existing* an occupied destination name is reported and skipped rather
    than refused, which is what a merge that must not overwrite needs. Without it an

    the only thing that can be sitting there is something planted.

    Symlinks and non-regular files are reported through *on_skip* and skipped;
