"""Configuration loader for KiroCrew.

Config location: ~/.kiro/crew/config.json (overridden by KIROCREW_HOME)
Credentials:    ~/.kiro/crew/.env (overridden by KIROCREW_HOME)

KiroCrew is KiroACP-only: the sole provider is the ACP adapter driving the
kiro-cli backend. This module handles session timeouts, hook rules, and the
dashboard URL via the config file. (The dashboard *port* is set with the
``KIROCREW_PORT`` env var, not a config key.)

    The companion to :func:`read_config_for_update`. Two properties matter:

    * **Atomic** (tmp+rename) so a concurrent reader can never observe a
      half-written file. A truncate-then-write leaves a window in which a reader
      sees invalid JSON; a reader that mistakes that for "no settings" will write
      the emptiness back and destroy the user's config.
    * **Mode-preserving.** Because tmp+rename creates a NEW inode, the umask
      default (typically ``0644``) would silently replace an operator's tightened
      ``0600``. ``config.json`` can hold inline credentials, so a settings write
      must never widen who can read it. An existing file's mode is carried over;
      a newly created one defaults to owner-only.

    ``atomic_write``'s ``mode`` routes through ``fchmod_safe``, which applies the
    mode on POSIX and is a documented no-op on Windows.

    **Windows gets a real owner-only DACL, not just the inert mode.** This used
    to deliberately skip ``platform_compat.restrict_to_owner`` because that helper
    shelled out to ``icacls`` — a blocking subprocess this function could not
    afford, being called from ``async`` request handlers and from
    ``KiroCrewConfig.save()``. That constraint no longer exists: the lockdown is
    applied in-process through ``advapi32`` (measured at 0.24 ms, against 313 ms
    for the subprocess it replaced), so it is safe on the event loop and the
    reason to omit it is gone. Since ``config.json`` can carry inline provider
    tokens and API keys, applying it is the correct default rather than a duty
    pushed onto each caller.

    The two guarantees do not collide, because they apply on different platforms:
    mode preservation is a POSIX concept (Windows has no bits to preserve), and
    the DACL is a Windows concept. Hence the platform branch below rather than
    passing both to ``atomic_write``, which refuses ``restrict_to_owner=True``
    alongside a wider explicit ``mode``.

    **On a network-homed data home the DACL turns on the CALLER, not the volume.**
    The in-process lockdown costs 0.24 ms on a local volume but is bounded only by
    SMB on a UNC or mapped-drive path, which a write running inline on the event
    loop cannot afford. That is a fact about the calling thread, so it is asked as
    one, via :func:`kiro_crew.atomic_write.on_event_loop`. A caller that has
    offloaded this write -- ``dashboard/chat_utils.run_config_write``, any
    ``asyncio.to_thread`` wrapper, and every CLI and startup path, which have no
    loop at all -- blocks only its own thread and therefore gets the owner-only
    DACL on **any** volume. Only a write still inline on the loop falls back to
    classifying the volume and skipping when it is remote.

    """Perform an atomic read-modify-write of a config file under an advisory lock.

    The locked primitive for the converted config.json writers and the required
    path for new config.json mutations.  Legacy writers that pre-date this
    function (dashboard agents endpoint, updates.py, security.py,
    messaging.py, mcp.py, core.py STT) still use
    :func:`write_config_atomically` directly and rely on the in-process asyncio
    ``_get_config_lock()`` only.  ``memory.py`` was in that list and has been
    converted; it now reaches this function through
    ``dashboard/chat_utils.run_config_write``.

    Contract:

    * **Isolation.** An advisory file lock is held for the entire
      read-modify-write, so two concurrent callers are serialized: neither can
      land between the other's read and write.
    * **Sidecar lockfile.** The lock lives on ``<path>.lock``, NOT on the
      config file's own fd.  ``write_config_atomically`` replaces the inode
      (tmp + rename), so a lock taken on the config file's fd would not
      serialize against the rename — a second opener after the rename gets a
      NEW fd on the NEW inode and takes the lock instantly, defeating the
      purpose.
    * **Fail-closed read (default).** :func:`read_config_for_update` is used
      inside the critical section; with ``on_corrupt="fail"`` (the default), an
      unreadable or malformed config raises :class:`ConfigReadError`, aborts
      the update, and the lockfile is released.  The existing file is never
      overwritten with defaults.
    * **Reset-on-corrupt (opt-in).** With ``on_corrupt="reset"``, a
      :class:`ConfigReadError` inside the critical section is caught WHILE THE
      LOCK IS STILL HELD and the *mutate* callback is invoked with ``{}``.
      The caller's write therefore happens in the same lock hold as the read
      attempt, closing any window for a concurrent writer to land between.
      The resulting file is written with mode ``0o600`` (no existing mode to
      preserve from a corrupt file).
    * **Mode-preserving write.** :func:`write_config_atomically` preserves the
      existing file's permission bits, so a tightened ``0600`` is not widened.
    * **Cross-platform.** Locking goes through
      :func:`platform_compat.file_lock`, which uses ``fcntl.flock`` on POSIX
      and a bounded ``msvcrt.locking`` spin on Windows.
    * **Symlink-safe.** The target path is resolved before locking, so a
      symlinked config is updated in place (matching
      ``write_config_atomically``'s behavior).

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : Path | None
        Config file path; defaults to :func:`config_path`.
    mutate : (dict) -> dict | None
        Called with the current config data (possibly ``{}`` for a new file).
        Must return the updated dict to write, or ``None`` to skip the write
        (useful when the mutate discovers no change is needed).
    fsync : bool
        Passed through to :func:`write_config_atomically`.
    stamp_meta : bool
        If True (default), stamps the ``meta`` block via
        :func:`stamp_config_meta` before writing.
    on_corrupt : "fail" | "reset"
        Behavior when :func:`read_config_for_update` raises
        :class:`ConfigReadError`.  ``"fail"`` (default) re-raises, aborting the
        update.  ``"reset"`` catches the error inside the lock hold and invokes
        *mutate* with ``{}``; the caller's write proceeds in the same critical
        section so no concurrent writer can land between.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The final config dict (after mutation), whether or not a write occurred.

    Raises
    ------
    ConfigReadError
        If the existing config is unreadable or malformed and
        ``on_corrupt="fail"``.
    OSError
        If the lockfile cannot be opened/created or the lock cannot be acquired.

    sends anyone debugging a version question chasing a build that is no

# config API (``dashboard/handlers/core.py`` for the agent knobs,
# ``session.py`` for ``pool_size``); they live HERE so the API-write gate and
# the load-time clamp below cannot drift apart.
#
# Why the loader must also clamp: the
# REST API rejects out-of-range writes, but a direct edit of ``config.json``
# (any process running as the same OS user — including a prompt-injected agent
# with file-write access) bypassed that gate entirely. Each of these knobs
# controls a resource-consumption dimension — concurrent subagent processes
# (each a separate kiro-cli process), per-agent turn budget (unbounded LLM
# calls + context growth), and pre-warmed pool processes spawned at startup —
# so an inflated on-disk value can exhaust host memory / CPU / the process
# table (denial of service). Clamping at load time makes the on-disk value
# untrusted above range no matter which consumer reads it, and also means the
# GET /api/config/kirocrew response (which serializes a freshly loaded config)
# reports the clamped value rather than the tampered one.

# transport's per-prompt wait follows this value (acp/client.py
# ``resolve_prompt_timeout``, which adds a margin so the dashboard's visible
# card fires before the transport cut), so the max is no longer pinned to the
# transport's 2h default. It is bounded at 24h because the ceiling is a runaway
# backstop, not a scheduler: a single prompt→response turn longer than a day is
# pathological, and multi-day unattended operation belongs to the loop
# mechanisms (monitor/goal loops, crons), which end the turn between cycles and
# survive restarts — a marathon turn does not. The floor keeps the backstop

# session's MCP servers, so start time scales with the agent's server count and
# per-server cold-start cost (observed: a 71-server agent with no pending OAuth
# completes in ~14s; a 17-server agent behind a sandboxed per-server launcher on
# a loaded host takes ~50s). The floor IS the default: the budget must stay
# comfortably ABOVE the backend's 30s OAuth authorization wait (issue #2946) —
# a lower value recreates the session-start race the dedicated budget exists to

    ``None`` means "no usable value here" and is deliberately NOT a number: each
    mechanism's fallback is its own documented default (``_RLIMIT_DEFAULTS`` for
    the rlimit path, ``_CGROUP_DEFAULT_*`` for the cgroup paths), and those must
    stay where they are rather than being copied into this dataclass as a third
    default set.

    The coercion rules, and why each one is what it is:

    - ``bool`` is not a number here. ``True`` would otherwise coerce to ``1`` and
      set a one-process / one-MB ceiling, which kills the child it limits.
    - A non-integral float TRUNCATES toward zero (``512.5`` -> ``512``), matching
      what every pre-existing reader did, so tightening the parse cannot loosen
      an operator's ceiling.
    - EXCEPT when it truncates to ``0``, either sign: ``0.5`` is not a request to
      disable the limit, but ``int(0.5)`` is exactly the value that means
      "disabled" on the rlimit path and "use the default" on the cgroup path.
      That silent reinterpretation is the trap in #3474, so it is refused.
    - NaN and +/-Infinity are refused before ``int()`` sees them. ``json.loads``
      accepts both literals, and ``int(inf)`` raises ``OverflowError`` --
      uncaught on the rlimit path, which turned a typo into a failure of every
      spawn.
    - Out of range REFUSES rather than clamps, and is checked on the value AS
      WRITTEN rather than on the truncated result. A clamp would silently move a
      confinement ceiling away from the number the operator can read in their own
      file; checking after truncation would let a value below the floor land back
      inside it (``int(-0.5) == 0`` passes a ``>= 0`` floor and then reads as
      "leave inherited", removing the ceiling entirely).

    Every refusal is logged once per key per process: the value is security
    relevant, so an operator must not have to infer it was dropped.

    the incompatible domains were written down nowhere and drifted apart.

    An APP's agents are copied into ``~/.kiro/agents/`` by
    ``apps.bridges._register_agents`` under a namespaced FILENAME
    (``<app>--<agent>.json``) while the config inside keeps the app's own bare
    ``name``. Nothing adds them to ``config.agents`` — that mapping is authored
    by setup / the user — so an app agent is resolvable by kiro-cli but is NOT a
    KiroCrew alias. Without this lookup :func:`resolve_agent_bindings` would fall
    all the way back to ``default_agent`` and silently dispatch the DEFAULT kiro
    agent for a session the user explicitly bound to an app's agent: the slot
    still shows the requested name (it is stored verbatim, unvalidated), so the
    UI claims "mochi" while the default agent answers, without the app's MCP
    tools.

    A pure in-memory set membership test — NO filesystem I/O, not even a stat.
    This is reached from ``_run_chat`` -> :func:`resolve_agent_bindings` on EVERY
    turn of an app-bound session (an app agent is never an alias, so it always
    takes this path), and a scan there would stall chat, WebSocket and heartbeat
    processing. The snapshot is refreshed only off-loop, by the gateway at boot
    and by ``_register_agents`` / ``_deregister_agents`` around their writes (see
    :func:`refresh_materialized_agents`).

    CONTRACT, stated deliberately because it is wider than the bug it fixes: this
    honors ANY parseable agent config in the directory, not only app-registered
    ones, and grafts the DEFAULT agent's workspace and memory bindings onto it. An
    agent created by kiro-cli's own flow, or dropped in by hand, therefore becomes
    dispatchable with default bindings — it is not restricted to
    ``bridges._register_agents`` output. That is intentional: the directory is the
    kiro-cli agent registry, every entry in it is a real agent kiro-cli can load,
    and narrowing to app-registered names would mean tracking provenance the
    directory does not record. It is safe inside the single-user trust boundary,
    and reads go through the sensitive-path gate (see
    :func:`_scan_materialized_agents`), but it IS a wider surface than "app agents
    dispatch" and should be read as such.

    When no snapshot exists yet, one is built lazily ONLY in a synchronous
    context (the CLI, tests) — never while an event loop is running, where an
    unwarmed lookup falls back to the default rather than block. Returns ``""``
    for a blank name or when nothing declares it, so a genuinely unknown agent
    still falls back to the default.

    *project_dir* adds the session's own ``<project>/.kiro/agents`` scope, which
    kiro-cli searches BEFORE the user-level directory (it resolves ``--agent``
    against its cwd, and Kiro Crew spawns it with the project dir as cwd). It
    deliberately does NOT use the snapshot: that is one process-wide set, while the
    project scope differs per session, so sharing it would leak one checkout's
    agents into another's.

    The project lookup reads the filesystem, so like the user-level scan it is
    NEVER performed on the event loop — see :func:`_project_declares_agent`. Callers
    that need a project agent resolved must therefore invoke this off the loop;
    ``chat_runner`` and the side-turn handler do so through the discovery pool. An
    on-loop call degrades to the default agent for that turn rather than stalling
    the gateway, which is the same trade the user-level scope already makes.

      name load rather than a mutex acquired once per slot per frame.
    * **Fails closed to "no claim".** A cold alias snapshot, a cold materialized

      note in ``chat_handlers`` on why storing the resolved name was destructive.
      This function only describes; the stored binding stays verbatim.

    *project_dir* widens the "honored" set to the session's own ``.kiro`` scope

       running the default agent.

    that project's own ``.kiro`` scope. It must be the same directory Kiro Crew
    passes as the kiro-cli cwd, so an agent found through it is one the backend
    will genuinely resolve; passing a directory the session does not run in would
    reintroduce the silent-substitution bug this lookup exists to prevent.
