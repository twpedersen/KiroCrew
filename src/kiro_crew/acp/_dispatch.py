"""Shared ACP dispatch helpers.

Single source of truth for the request shapes that BOTH ``AcpClient`` (legacy,
process-per-session) and ``AcpRuntime``/``AcpSessionHandle`` (shared runtime,
single-reader demux) must send identically. Keeping these here prevents the
two parallel implementations from drifting.

These are pure, stateless functions: they take primitives and return dicts, so
each class keeps its own I/O model (``_turn_lock`` reader vs per-session queue)
while sharing the data-shaping logic: session/new params, set_mode/set_model
request shapes, per-turn metadata/credit capture, and notification classification.
