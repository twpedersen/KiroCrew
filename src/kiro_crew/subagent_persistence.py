# ── per-agent write serialization ────────────────────────────────────

#: ``update_state`` is a read / merge / rewrite, and its two halves are split by
#: a blocking ``_atomic_write`` (fsync + rename). Two writers on one ``agent_id``
#: therefore interleave: the second one's read predates the first one's write, so
#: its rewrite restores a stale WHOLE-FILE snapshot and silently rolls back every
#: field the first writer had just landed. Losing the other writer's fields is
#: the visible half; rolling back fields NEITHER writer touched is the damaging
#: half.
#:
#: The overlap is structural, not hypothetical. A run writes state from the event
#: loop (PID, session id, provider, retention ``keep``) AND from the thread pool
#: (model provenance, CC-path model refinement, per-turn diagnostics -- each via
#: ``asyncio.to_thread``), so two pool writers overlap during a run and a
#: loop-side write executes while the run's coroutine is suspended inside a
#: pool-side one (#6298). Cancellation widens it: cancelling a ``to_thread``
#: await DETACHES the worker rather than stopping it, so it finishes carrying a
#: read that is already stale (#6308).
#:
#: SCOPE -- OFF-LOOP WRITERS ONLY. Serializing every writer would mean a
#: loop-side caller waiting on a pool thread's fsync, i.e. a new blocking call
#: on the event loop, which this repo's ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` anchor
#: forbids and which a bounded wait only shrinks rather than removes. So the lock
#: is taken only by callers that are NOT on the loop, where blocking is legal;
#: on-loop callers keep exactly their pre-existing behaviour (an unserialized
#: rewrite). That closes pool-vs-pool interleaving completely and leaves the
#: loop-side half untouched -- see :func:`update_state` for what remains open and
#: the issue tracking the loop-side offload (#6288's class).
#:
#: The acquire is UNBOUNDED, and can be, precisely because no on-loop caller ever
#: waits on it: the only threads that block here are pool workers whose own write
#: (read + fsync + rename) already exposes them to a wedged FS, so waiting on the
#: lock adds no parking risk the write itself did not already carry. No holder is
#: ever an on-loop caller.
#:
#: In-process only, mirroring the per-key ``threading.Lock`` registry this repo
#: already uses to serialize file read-modify-write (``learn._lock_for``,
#: ``artifacts._lock_for_root``, ``history.ConversationLog._file_locks``). A
#: filesystem lock is the tool for cross-process contention and there is none
#: here: every ``update_state`` caller lives in the gateway process that owns the
#: run. Keyed by agent id so unrelated runs never queue behind one agent's fsync,
#: SELF-CLEANING, with no explicit eviction anywhere. The values are held
#: WEAKLY and every caller keeps a strong reference for the length of its
#: critical section, so an entry lives exactly as long as some writer is using
#: it and then disappears on its own. That is a correctness property, not a
#: tidiness one: removing an entry explicitly while another writer still holds
#: or is queued on it SPLITS the lock's identity -- the next caller mints a
#: fresh lock and enters ``state.json`` alongside the writer still inside it,
#: which is the very loss this lock exists to prevent. Any hook that evicts
#: without holding the lock (a folder delete, the tombstone pruner) can do
#: exactly that, and the pruner's case is not even hypothetical: ``_atomic_write``
#: re-creates the parent directory, so a writer already inside its critical
#: section resurrects the folder the pruner just removed. Weak values make that
#: unrepresentable -- an entry cannot be dropped while anyone can still reach
#: it -- and agent ids are per-run uuids, so nothing accumulates either.
