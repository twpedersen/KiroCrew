    whose ``resources`` would load the skill via a ``skill://`` URI. Empty
    list means no agent loads it via the kiro-cli native loader (it may
    still be loaded via KiroCrew text-injection or an external MCP server).

    ``?agent=<name>`` scopes the listing to that agent's own ``skill://``
    mapping (matching the same globs the prompt-injection path resolves via
    :func:`agent_skill_globs`) — filtered to skills in that agent's

    all-or-nothing listing: an agent that never customized its skill set
    must not lose access to skills a customized agent's presence would
    otherwise imply are opt-in.

    When the agent filter is actually applied (agent given AND its globs are

    ``{"skills": [...], "agent_scoped": true, "agent": <name>}`` instead of
    the bare array. The flag is required wiring, not decoration: a filtered
    list — especially an EMPTY one — is byte-identical to the legacy
    unfiltered array, so without it the client cannot tell "no skills are
    mapped to this agent" apart from "no skills exist at all". Every
