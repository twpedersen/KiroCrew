"""Opt-in end-to-end check: Kiro Crew -> a real OpenTelemetry Collector.

The two automated tiers in ``test/metrics/test_otlp_wire_e2e.py`` cover
serialization and the OTLP/HTTP wire without any external process, which is why
they can run in CI. Neither proves that a *real collector* accepts what we send:
a payload can decode correctly and still be rejected by the collector's own
validation, and only a collector can show what a vendor exporter would receive.

That check needs a downloaded binary and outbound network, so it cannot run in a
network-isolated CI and is deliberately NOT a test. Run it by hand:

    python3 scripts/telemetry/otlp_collector_e2e.py --expected-sha256 <digest>

It downloads a PINNED collector release, verifies it, runs it with a file
exporter, drives one real Kiro Crew export into it, and asserts every required
instrument plus the resource attributes arrived. Nothing is installed system-wide
and everything lands in a temp directory that is removed on exit.

SUPPLY CHAIN. Verifying against a digest you already trust is the DEFAULT, and the
script refuses to download anything without one. The weaker path is an explicit,
named opt-in:

    python3 scripts/telemetry/otlp_collector_e2e.py --trust-release-checksums

That accepts the ``checksums.txt`` published with the release, whose trust root is
only GitHub serving that release — the checksums come from the same origin as the
bytes they attest, so a compromised release can serve a matching pair. It exists
to bootstrap: it prints the observed digest, which you then pin. The refusal comes
BEFORE the download rather than after, because fetching first and only then
finding there is nothing to check against is how a "verified" script ends up
running an unverified binary. A digest mismatch is always fatal.
